<H2><A NAME="Overview">Overview</A></H2>
<P>
This plug-in provides
<A HREF="http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</A>
functionality as an Eclipse plug-in into the Java development environment of Eclipse.
ESC/Java2 checks that Java programs obey specifications written as
Java Modeling Language (<A HREF="http://www.jmlspecs.org">JML</A>) annotations.
You may want to use the plug-in along with the 
<A HREF="http://projects.cis.ksu.edu/projects/jmleclipse">JMLEclipse plug-in</A> and the
<A HREF="http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/download">Daikon plug-in</A>.  The JML plug-in
in particular provides functionality for checking and manipulating annotation
files.  The Daikon plug-in generates JML annotations from execution traces of
programs.
<p>
This plugin is also available as part of the <a href="http://kind.ucd.ie/prpoducts/opensource/Mobius">
MOBIUS program verification environment (PVE)</a>
</p>
<P>
The plug-in adds the following functionality to Eclipse's Java Perspective:
<UL>
<LI>A menubar item labeled 'JML' with a number of submenu items that
invoke various tools and manage the environment.
<LI>A toolbar item labeled 'Run ESC/Java2' that invokes the ESC/Java2 checker.
<LI>A problem marker (a red disk with an 'E' on it) for ESC/Java2 problems;
these must be enabled in the Filters menu of the Problems view (they are
disabled by default).
<LI>Context menu items in various views 
and on Java editors that replicate some
of the above menu items for Java Projects, source
folders, packages, and compilation
units.
<LI>A console page to which output from Esc/Java2 is sent.
<LI>An ESC/Java2 preferences page in the Java group of preference pages
(under Window &gt;&gt; Preferences).
<LI>An ESC/Java2 builder that is visible (when the ESC/Java2 Builder is enabled) 
in the Project Properties Builders page.
<LI>A decoration visible in the package explorer (and other places)
on Java Projects with autochecking enabled.  There is a toggle
named 'ESC/Java2' to enable these decorations in the Label Decorations page of
the workbench preferences.
<LI>A new category of (unbound) commands in the Workbench &gt;&gt; Keys page of the workbench
preferences.  The category is named 'ESC/Java2' and allows key bindings to be 
defined for the various new menu actions. 
<LI>A Help document describing the ESC/Java2 plug-in functionality available
through the Help &gt;&gt; HelpContents menu (this document).
</UL>

The capabilities of the command-line ESC/Java2 checker are integrated into
the plug-in, along with preferences that are equivalent to the various
command-line options of the ESC/Java2 tool.
</P>

<H2><A name="Installation">Installation</A></H2>
<H3><Prerequisite</H3>
This plugin requires Eclipse version 3.4 or higher.  It checks Java 1.3, Java 
1.4 or Java Card 2.1 code.  This plugin is based on version 2.0.5 of ESC/Java2,
version 2.0.6 of Javafe and version 1.5.6 of Simplify.

<P>
The plug-in is installed from a standard Eclipse update site as follows.
    <ul>
     <li> Start Eclipse.
     <li> Open the dialog at Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates
     <li> Select "New Remote Site" or "Add Site".  Fill in the dialog with the URL 
          <a href="http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/mobius/updates/">
          http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/mobius/updates </a>, and press "OK".
     <li> Select "Mobius PVE" in the list of sites to search and press "Next&gt;".
     <li> If all is well, the available versions of the plug-in will be displayed under Mobius,
          select the most recent Esc/Java2 version and press "Next&gt;".  
     <li> Read and accept the license terms, and press "Next&gt;".
     <LI> Choose the local installation site into which you want to install the plug-in
          (or add a new one for experimentation); then press 'Finish'.  You will likely
          be asked to restart the workspace, which you should do, otherwise the menu
          items may not appear.
     <LI> Within the file system, find the installation site plugins directory,
          and set all of the Simplify* files to have executable permission.
          (As of version 1.1.1, this should be taken care of automatically when
          the Simplify executable is first used, but it is best if the installer
          fixes the permissions at install time.)
     <LI> The plug-in will be available from any newly opened workspace from this
          installation site.
     <LI> The plug-in can be disabled or uninstalled 
          using Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Manage Configuration.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> The <A
      HREF="https://mobius.ucd.ie/browser/src/escjava_plugin">source
      code</A> for the plug-in is available, in accord with the <A
      HREF=http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html>Eclipse Common Public
      License</A>.
</p>
<P>
If you simply want to update a previous installation of ESC/Java2,
then do the following:
<UL>
     <LI> Open an Eclipse workspace and choose Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Find and Install.
     <LI> Choose "Search for updates..." and "Next&gt;"
     <LI> Select the feature version to install and "Next&gt;"
     <LI> Read and accept the license terms, and press "Next&gt;".
     <LI> Choose the local installation site into which you want to install the plug-in
          (or add a new one for experimentation); then press 'Finish'.  You will likely
          be asked to restart the workspace, which you should do.
     <LI> The updated plug-in will be available from any newly opened workspace from this
          installation site. <!-- FIXME - verify the above -->
</UL>
</P>

<P>In order to uninstall the plugin, do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Choose Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Manage Configuration
<LI> Click the + symbol by the install location from which you wish to uninstall the plugin
<LI> Choose the Esc/Java2 feature from the list of installed features
<LI> Select Uninstall in the right hand panel
<LI> Confirm the Uninstall and restart the workbench
</UL>

<P>

Once installed, there are a few setup actions that the user needs to
do to avoid becoming confused later on. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Enable the ESC/Java2 markers</B> - By default new marker types
are not displayed in the 'Problems' View.  To correct this, open
the 'Problems' View (typically in the lower right pane in a Java
Perspective), and then open the 'Filter' dialog using the toolbar
item or the menu on the right end of the Problems view's toolbar.
Make sure that the 'ESC/Java2 Warning' entry is checked.
<LI><B>Define file associations for specification file suffixes</B> -
The Java perspective does not treat specification files as first-class
Java files, but it is at least helpful to be able to use the
Java editor on these files.  So choose Window &gt;&gt; Preferences and
then Workbench &gt;&gt; File Associations.  In turn, add the entries
'*.refines-java', '*.refines-spec', '*.refines-jml', '*.spec'
and '*.jml' as new file types in the upper panel and add the
Java Editor as the default editor for each of these suffixes in the lower
panel.
<LI>Be sure the <B>ESC/Java2 Label Decorations</B> are turned on in the 
Label Decorations page of the Workbench preferences.
<LI>Optionally define any desired <B>key bindings</B> for the various menu actions.
Use the ESC/Java2 category in the Keys page of the Workbench preferences to do this.
Add the key bindings to be effective in Windows or in Dialogs & Windows.
<LI>Other preferences relevant to the Esc/Java2 plug-in may be set on the
<B>Esc/Java2 preferences page</B> under the Java category.  (The preferences page is
obtained from the Window &gt;&gt; Preferences menu item.)
</UL>
</P>
<P>
There is one other important action that is taken care of automatically
but that the user should be aware of.
<UL>

<LI><B>JML specifications for the Java system and JML Model classes</B> - To use
ESC/Java2 (or other JML-based tools) effectively, the tool needs to reference a
copy of the JML specifications for the Java system classes.  A copy of these
is contained in the ESC/Java2 plug-in.  When a project is enabled for
ESC/Java2 checking, a specification project (named JmlSpecs) is automatically
created and added to the workspace.  This project contains a link to the 
library of system specifications; the project is also added to the classpath
of the enabled project, so that the specifications are seen when individual
files are checked.
<P>
You may need to adjust the position of the specifications in the classpath.
<P>
If you have other versions of the system specifications (or other sets 
of specifications for other libraries), you can conveniently add them
to your Java Projects by ...
<!-- TODO - FIXME
using the JML &gt;&gt; Setup &gt;&gt; Link in Specs Library 
menu item.  This allows you the choice of adding a set of specifications
as either a stand-alone project or as a new source folder in a 
specific project.  Using a standalone project makes it easier to 
share the specs among multiple projects and to toggle the use of the
specs on and off within a given project.
-->

</UL>
</P>

<H2><A name="General_comments">General comments</A></H2>
<P>
Here are some aspects to be aware of in using the plug-in.
<UL>
<LI>
The ESC/Java2 functionality is provided by integrating the 
Eclipse extension capabilities directly with the ESC/Java2 tool.
ESC/Java2 is a standalone tool with its own
parser and compiler for Java.  Consequently, when ESC/Java2 operations
are run within Eclipse, the Java files are parsed over again.
This can result in duplicate error messages (as well as slower than 
ideal performance).
<LI>
ESC/Java2 operates on files as they exist in the file system.  
Thus editors within Eclipse must be saved if ESC/Java2 is to see any 
newly edited material.
<LI>
Defining the Java Editor as the editor for the specification file suffixes
goes only part of the way towards convenient handling of specification files within
Eclipse.  In particular, one difficulty is that editing specification files 
will not trigger an
incremental compilation. <!-- [other difficulties? - FIXME]. -->
<LI>
The Eclipse framework operates on projects one by one.  This is 
required because attributes such as the relevant classpath for
compiling the project may differ from project to project.  Hence
ESC/Java2 (and JML tools) must also operate project by project; this is ordinarily
not a problem but can in some circumstances lead to slow or 
undesirable results.  This problem is avoided if everything that
can be compiled with a given classpath is contained in one project,
with one output bin directory,
possibly using multiple source folders.
<LI>
ESC/Java2 was not designed for interactive use.
Consequently operations cannot be canceled and restarted readily,
so the user may experience a slow response to cancellation.  The
tool also is not designed to support incremental analysis.
<LI>
Internal errors or unexpected exceptional situations are logged in 
Eclipse's error log.  The ESC/Java2 page of the Eclipse Console
 may be used to report progress and general debugging information, if
 that output is enabled in the ESC/Java2 preferences page.
</UL>
</P>

<A NAME="#Menus"/>
<H2>Menu and toolbar functionality</H2>
<P>
The top menubar provides the following functionality.  The toolbar
and the context menus replicate some of this functionality.  The menubar
item is labeled 'JML' because it is shared with menu items from the JMLEclipse
plug-in.
</P>
<P>
Each of the menu operations act on the currently selected set of objects.
If an editor is selected and active, the operation will apply to the
one Java compilation unit in that editor.  
In Eclipse's Package Explorer view, multiple items may
be selected.  The operations will act appropriately on 
each selected Java Project,
source folder and Package Fragment root within a Java Project, 
Java Package Fragment, Java compilation unit, or non-.java 
specification file within a Java Project.  Selecting a container item will cause
the relevant operation to be performed on all the items within the 
container.
</P>
<A NAME="#Checks"/>
<H3>ESC/Java2 Checking</H3>
<P>
This operation runs an Esc/Java2 check on each selected item or its contents.
The operation can be initiated from the menu item or by the 'ESC' item on the
toolbar or from various context menus.
Any syntax errors or Esc/Java2 warnings are presented as problem markers.  
The problem markers are shown along the left edge of each editor at the line
corresponding to the problem.  If
problem markers are enabled in the Problems View, then details of the problem
are shown in the Problems View.  Additional information, such as the
specification that is being violated by the line in question, can be obtained
using the 'Go to associated declaration' menu operation.  This menu item performs
a check whether or not the Esc/Java2 nature is enabled for automatic checking.
</P><P>  
<B>Be sure to save any edited files before invoking an ESC/Java2 check!</B>
ESC/Java2 operates only on the files as they exist in the file system and not
on material in an editor within Eclipse.
</P><P>
An ESC/Java2 Check operation needs to parse files other than those selected
if they are referenced by the selected files.  Thus errors may be
detected (and markers produced) in files other than those selected.

</P><P>
Prior to executing the checking operation, all markers are cleared 
from the selected files, so that a fresh set of error reports is
available.  However, non-selected files are not cleared, which may
result in multiple markers being produced for problems in other files.
Also, if the error is subsequently corrected but the file with the marker is
not selected when the JML Checker is run again, the marker will not be
cleared even though the problem is no longer present.
</P>
<A NAME="#Clear"/>
<H3>Clear Esc/Java2 Markers</H3>
The Clear operation removes all problem markers from any selected files or
files within selected containers.

<A NAME="#GoTo"/>
<H3>Go to associated declaration</H3>
Most Esc/Java2 warnings have an associated declaration.  For example, an 
assignment of a value to a field may violate a specification that the field
always be non-null.  That specification is located at the declaration of the
field, and not at the line with the invalid assignment.  The problem marker
will be located at the line with the invalid assignment; the associated 
declaration is the non-null specification of the field declaration.  This menu
item operates on a selected problem marker and will open the file containing
the associated declaration and highlight the line containing the declaration.
A problem marker can be selected by either highlighting the problem marker in
the Problems View or by selecting some text in the line in the editor containing
the problem.  It is not sufficient to simply place the cursor in the offending
line; you must select a range of text. 
<A NAME="#Setup"/>
<H3>Setup</H3>
The submenu items in this menu allow the installing and deinstalling of 
the Esc/Java2 automatic checker within projects.  

<A NAME="#Enable"/>
<H3>Enable Esc/Java2 checking</H3>
Enabling the Esc/Java2
checker will install the Esc/Java2 nature on the project and enable the
automatic builder.  Then after any compilation (even an incremental compilation),
the Esc/Java2 checker will be run on all the compilation units of the project.
The checker will be run on the entire project immediately upon enabling the
automatic builder.

<A NAME="#Disable"/>
<H3>Disable Esc/Java2 checking</H3>
This menu action disables the Esc/Java2 automatic checking.
Note that you can also disable automatic checking on the Builders page of the
Project &gt;&gt; Properties menu item.

<!-- FIXME
<P>
<A NAME="#EnableSelected"/>
<H4>Enable JML in SELECTED projects</H4>
This operation will install JML and add the builders, specifications, and 
runtime library in any project that is
selected (or has an element that is selected).  If a project is already
enabled, no action occurs.  Note that the builders are always added in
default mode (checker and RAC enabled, jmldoc disabled) regardless of 
any previous state.  A decoration appears on the Project icon in
the Package Explorer indicating that the project has JML installed.
<A NAME="#DisableSelected"/>
<H4>Disable JML in SELECTED projects</H4> 
This operation will disable JML and remove the builders from any project that is
selected (or has an element that is selected).  If a project is already
disabled, no action occurs.   Specifications and the runtime library will remain.
<A NAME="#EnableAll"/>
<H4>Enable JML in ALL projects</H4>
Enables JML as described above for all Java projects (but not necessarily for new ones),
ignoring any selection.
<A NAME="#DisableAll"/>
<H4>Disable JML in ALL projects</H4>
Disables JML as described above for all Java projects, ignoring any selection.
<A NAME="#LinkSpecs"/>
<H4>Link in Specs library...</H4>
The default specifications library is inserted into JML-enabled projects
automatically.  This menu item allows the user to perform this task 
manually or to add to a project a different set of specifications.  There 
are two ways to add specifications to a project.
<UL>
<LI><B>As a project</B>:  In this case (the easier to work with), the specifications
will appear in a new project of their own and the project will be added to
the classpath of any selected Java projects.  Leave
the check box ("Link in as project") checked, choose a name for the project
that is to contain the specs and a name for the source folder within
the project.  The project name must be one that you will not use for
other purposes; the folder name can be any legal source folder name.
Then type in or browse to the file system location of the specifications
that you want to make available to the project.  These must be in source 
file, not jar, format.  Select 'OK'.  You may also want to adjust the
oder of items in the classpath in the project's properties ('JavaBuild Path' page, 
'Order and Export' tab).  If you like, you may also add other specification
libraries to the new project.
<LI><B>As a source folder</B>: In this case the selected projects will
each be modified by the addition of a new source folder within the project that will be linked
to the file system location of the specifications.  Uncheck the
toggle marked "Link in as project".  The project name is ignored; choose
a source folder name that will not conflict with other source folders
that you have or will create in the selected projects.  Type in or
browse to the file-system location of the specifications you wish to 
use.  Select 'OK' and adjust, if necessary, the order of items in the
project's classpath.
</UL>
-->



<A NAME="#Preferences"/>
<H2>ESC/Java2 preferences</H2>
The plug-in provides a new preference page under Window&gt;&gt;Preferences; it is
contained under the 'Java' heading.
All the items in the ESC/Java2 preferences page are global to all 
Java projects.  

<A NAME="#EclipseOptions"/>
<H3>Options for Escjava-Eclipse</H3>
This group of options does not affect Esc/Java2 per se.  Rather they control 
aspects of the plug-in.

<P>
<B>Enable Eclipse informational messages.</B> 
Enabling this option turns on printing of 
progress and debug messages relating to the operation
of the plug-in itself. (Default is off.) Errors and warnings are always displayed.
</P><P>
<B>Log to the Eclipse console.</B>
Error and informational output from the plug-in
can be directed to one of two places, depending on the
status of this toggle.  If the toggle is checked (the default),
progress and debug output is sent to the Eclipse console of the instance
of Eclipse that is running the program being executed.  If the toggle
is not checked, then the output is sent to <code>System.out</code>.  Depending
on the way in which Eclipse was started, this output may end up in the
terminal from which Eclipse was started, the console of a parent
Eclipse process, or may be lost entirely.
</P><P>
<B>Send informational output to the log file also.</B>
When unchecked (the default), only error output is recorded in the system
log file (as seen in Eclipse's Error Log view).  By enabling this option,
informational output is also logged in the log and can be seen in the Error
Log view.  Normally this simply clutters up the Error Log, but it can be helpful
in some situations to capture all of the output in one place.
</P>

<A NAME="#EscjavaOptions"/>
<H3>Options related to ESC/Java2</H3>

<P>
<B>Simplify executable to use.</B>
Esc/Java uses Simplify as its decision procedure and must have available a
version of Simplify appropriate for the host platform.  Various versions of
Simplify are included with the plug-in; by default an internal version is 
chosen that matches the host operating system.  The user can also explicitly
chose a particular version using the <B>Internal Simplify Version</B> choice
menu (if, for example, the internal logic fails to pick the appropriate
version).  The user can also use an external version of Simplify by deselecting
the <B>Use Internal Version</B> toggle and entering the absolute path to an
appropriate executable in the text field (possibly using the <I>Browse</I> button
as an aid).  The default internal choice should almost always be adequate.
</P><P>
<B>Type check only.</B>
With this option enabled, only syntax and typechecking is performed.  No
checks are made as to whether JML annotations are adhered to by the source code.
It can be used to quickly check that the annotations (and source code) are 
well-formed, without trying any time-consuming verification.  The default is to
do both typechecking and static checking. (<code>-typecheck</code> option)
</P><P>
<B>No semicolon warnings.</B>
JML requires that annotations be terminated with semicolons.  The original
Esc/Java did not require this.  Esc/Java2 will warn about missing semicolons,
but can successfully process some annotations that are missing these terminating
semicolons.  Enabling this toggle will turn off warnings about semicolons.
The default is to warn about semicolon errors. (<code>-nosemicolonwarnings</code> option)
</P>
<P><B>Enable caution messages.</B> 
This option (equivalent to the inverse of the command-line option <code>-nocautions</code>)
turns on Caution messages.  Cautions include syntactical errors that have an
obvious correction, non-implemented features and internal errors that Esc/Java2
recovers from. (default is to issue cautions)
</P>
<P><B>Enables checking that annotations are pure.</B>
If enabled (the default), all expressions within annotations, including method
calls, are required to be pure, as JML requires. (<code>-checkPurity</code> option)
</P>
<P><B>Enables output of counterexample information.</B>
If enabled, then in cases where verification of an assertion fails, cryptic
information giving a counterexample is output. The default is off.
(<code>-counterexample</code> option)
</P>
<P><B>Enables output of suggestion information.</B>
If enabled, then in cases where verification of an assertion fails, 
information giving suggested annotations to fix the problem is output. The default is off.
(<code>-suggest</code> option)
</P>
<P><B>Disable ESC/Java2 informational messages.</B>
ESC/Java2 can issue informational messages about its progress.  These are 
 disabled by default.  They can be enabled by turning off this toggle.  The
 messages will appear in the Eclipse console. <!-- FIXME - what option -->
</P>

<P><B>Java source version.</B>
Use this option to specify the version of Java source code that is being used.
Using version "1.4" enables the <code>assert</code> identifier to be treated as
a keyword and for the assert statement to be interpreted as specified by Java.
<!-- Using "1.5" enables all of the Java 5.0 (1.5) language enhancements [which are
not yet implemented in Esc/Java2.] -->
The default is version 1.4.  (<code>-source</code> option)
</P>
<P><B>Behavior of assert statement.</B>
Use this option to define the behavior of Java 1.4 assert statements.  The options
are to ignore assert statements, to treat them as Java statements (the default),
 or to convert
them to JML assertions.<!-- FIXME - what option -->
</P>

<A NAME="#EscjavaWarnings"/>
<H3>Esc/Java2 Warnings</H3>
Esc/Java2 checks for various potential violations of JML specifications. Where
it suspects problems (or cannot prove that a problem will not happen), it
issues a <em>warning</em>.  There are various kinds of warnings.  These are 
listed on the right side of the preferences page.  By default, Esc/Java2 checks
for all warning types except Deadlock.  The user can select which warnings
Esc/Java2 should check for and which to ignore.  Explanations of each of these
warnings are given in the documentation about Esc/Java2.  A brief explanation
is given in the tooltip on the option.

<A NAME="#Features"/>
<H2>Other Features</H2> 
<A NAME="#Markers"/A>
<H3>ESC/Java2 Problem Markers</H3>
<P>
The plug-in defines a new type of Problem marker that is used to indicate
syntax errors or warnings about potential specification violations
that the Esc/Java2 tool finds.  The marker icon is a 
black 'E' superimposed on a red dot.  The icon is shown in the ruler along the
left edge of Java editors at the line where a problem is identified.  Tooltip
information, shown when the mouse pointer remains steady over the icon for a short
period of time, gives details of the problem. 
</P><P>
The 
details of the problem are also shown in the Problems View.  Note that the Problems 
View has a filter that chooses which types of problems are to be shown.  The
ESC/Java2 problem type is NOT shown by default and must be enabled in the 
filters menu of the Problems View.  (The filters menu is found by selecting either
the Filters icon or the down-arrow Menu icon in the upper right corner of the
Problems View).
</P>
<A NAME="#Console"/A>
<H3>Esc/Java2 Console</H3>
The Eclipse Console View is available to plug-ins to show textual output from
plug-in tools.  The Console has a number of panes.  The Esc/Java2 plug-in adds
a new pane, called 'Esc/Java2', to which output from the Esc/Java2 plug-in or
tool is sent.  The Console view generally automatically switches to the pane
with recent output, but on some occasions the user may have to choose the
pane manually to see the Esc/Java2 output.

<A NAME="#Context"/>
<H3>Context Menus</H3>
The context menu in the Package Navigator (obtained with a right mouse press over
an item in the Package Navigator tree hierarchy) has menu options pertinent
to the context in which the menu is invoked.  A 'Run Esc/Java2' action is added
to the Package Navigator context menus; this action is the equivalent of the
'Esc/Java2' checking action under 'JML' in the menubar.  The additional menu
item is also available in the Outline View.

<A NAME="#Builder"/>
<H3>ESC/Java2 Automatic Builder</H3>
<P>
When ESC/Java2 is enabled for a project
(e.g. by the JML &gt;&gt; Setup &gt;&gt; Enable Esc/Java2 menu item), then 
a new Incremental Builder becomes available on the Project's
Builders Properties page.  Once present, the builders can be 
enabled and disabled on the Builders page.
</P>
<P>
When the 'ESC/Java2 AutoCheck' Builder is enabled, then whenever compilation
takes place within a project, all files in that project are ESC/Java2-checked
after being compiled.
Success or failure of this checking is shown by the presence of 
ESC/Java2 markers
in each file, just as errors from the Java compiler are show by Java Problem markers.
</P>
<P>Enabling auto checking will cause Eclipse to immediately run a compilation
cycle.
</P>
<P>
Note that changing the options on the ESC/Java2 preferences page does not
constitute changing the file and will not provoke an incremental
recompilation (and ESC/Java2 rechecking) of the files.  Instead, if you
change the ESC/Java2 options (when you have auto checking enabled),
do a clean rebuild of the files (or a gratuitous edit and save within them).
Be sure to save any edited files, or have 'Save automatically before build'
enabled on the Workbench Preferences page (from the Window&gt;&gt;Preferences menu item). 
</P>

<A NAME="#Decorators"/>
<H3>ESC/Java2 Label Decorations</H3>
The plug-in adds a new label decoration to the Eclipse framework.  
Label Decorators can be
enabled or disabled on the Workbench&gt;&gt;Label Decorations page of the
workbench Preferences.  When enabled here, a decoration may be shown on
icons in the Package Explorer view.
<UL>
<LI>A miniscule version of the JML logo (a mostly yellow coffee cup)
appears as an Upper Right
overlay for Java Projects that have ESC/Java2 enabled.
 (It lies on top of the
blue J indicating a Java Project.)
<!-- FIXME
<LI>Java Compilation Unit icons have an Upper Left overlay indicating
the following states:
<UL>
<LI>ESC/Java2 enabled for this file AND the ESC/Java2 builder is enabled 
for the containing project - the overlay is
the miniscule JML logo
<LI>ESC/Java2 enabled for this file, but the ESC/Java2 builder is not enabled 
for this project - the overlay is a 
JML logo with a red circle-and-diagonal-line (NO) symbol through it
<LI>ESC/Java2 not enabled for this file - no decoration
</UL>
-->
</UL>

<A NAME="#Commands"/>
<H3>ESC/Java2 Key Bindings</H3>
The 'Keys' page of the Workbench preferences allows the user to 
associate key bindings with any 
command.  There is a ESC/Java2 category of commands.  
No key bindings are defined by default, but the
user may choose to add some.  Make sure they are enabled for 'Windows'
or 'Dialogs and Windows'.

<A NAME="#Help"/>
<H3>ESC/Java2 Help</H3>
Help information (this document) is available through the Help menu.
Select the Help menu item on the menubar and the 'Help Contents'
sub-menu item.  One of the help topics shown is 'ESC/Java2'.   Selecting
that topic will bring up the ESC/Java2 Help document.
<P>
In addition all the various toolbar and dialog box controls have tool tip
information that gives a bit more explanation of the purpose of the item.
</P>

<H2>Problems to fix and features to add</H2>

This section summarizes in bullet form  
outstanding issues and future would-be-nice features.

<H3>Major nuisances</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Implement and document how to insert alternate sets of specs
<LI>Implement going to an associated declaration from the cursor position or
from the context menu of a marker in the ruler or from the context menu in the
problem view
<LI>Implement and document checking just one method
<LI>Implement and document incremental checking
<LI>Implement and document appropriate dependencies in checking, including 
dependencies on specification files (adding, removing, editing them)
<LI>Implement and document cleaning as part of auto building
<LI>Implement and document autosaving as part of manual checking
<LI>Implement cancelation and progress dialogs
<LI>Capture the output for a given method in a way that can be shown for each 
method, rather than strung out in the Console.
<LI>Need the rest of Esc/java2 command-line options as GUI options
<LI>Be able to show the VCs in FRIENDLY way
<LI>Be able to show counterexamples in a user-friendly way
<LI>Better handling of editors for spec files
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Check documentation of updating a feature
<LI>The warning types need tooltips
<LI>Use the build problem reporting facilities
<LI>Make the use of Esc/Java2 and ESC/java2 consistent.
<LI>The icon in the Problems View ought to be the Esc/Java2 problem icon.
<LI>The JDK specs include the esctools files themselves.
<LI>Should we have the option of using the JDK specs as a library in the project
rather than a separate project.
<LI>Allow a choice of which pane of the Console to use? (JML or Esc/Java2)
<LI>Need an option for the name of the specs project
<LI>Some markers have more than one associated declaration - be able to
