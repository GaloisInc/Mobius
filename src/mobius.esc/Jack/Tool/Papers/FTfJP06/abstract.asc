 Adding native specifications to JML
 

Abstract:
In the specification language JML we can see pure methods as a way to
express user-defined predicates that will simplify the annotations.
We take this idea a step further in allowing
to only declare these predicates in JML without giving an explicit definition.
The explicit definition is done directly in the language
to which the Java program and the specifications are
translated. To this end we introduce a new keyword to JML, the keyword 'native'.
To facilitate these definitions we have enabled the user to define
also 'native' types in the same way.
In this paper we will describe these new constructs as well as their implementation in Jack,
 and their application to JML's libraries and model fields.
