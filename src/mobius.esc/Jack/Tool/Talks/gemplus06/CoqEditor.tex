\nextslide{Existing editors}

\blist 
\item Standard tools:
  \blist \small
     \item Proof General (emacs)
     \item CoqIde (ocaml)
  \elist
\item More related works:
  \blist \small
     \item PCoq (Java)
     \item The new proof general (integrated in eclipse, but only for Isabelle)
  \elist
\elist

\nextslide{Motivations}
\small
At first:
\blist
\item Editor not included in Jack's Coq plugin
\item The use of {\purple CoqIde} or {\purple ProofGeneral} to edit Jack's Coq files
\elist
What for?
\blist
  \item Separating the {\purple library controlling Coq} from Jack
  \item Jack is already in Eclipse, why not edit Coq files in it too?
  \item Proof General is getting in Eclipse but for now not it looks 'dead'
  \item need a light-weight multi-prover interface in Eclipse
\elist



\nextslide{ProverEditor}
\small
It has:
\blist 
\item \ {\purple syntax highlighting}
 for both the Coq file and the proof view window
\item the same keyboard shortcuts as CoqIde
\elist
Gain:
\blist
\item Full integration within eclipse: 
  \blist 
  \item no weird pop-up except if the user wants to use another editor
  \item the managing of the proof files made a bit easier
  \elist
  
\item As a separate developpement: better handling of Coq than 
  what was done within Jack, and also usable with ESC/Java
\item Handling of {\purple large} files ($>$ 1 Mo)
\elist
