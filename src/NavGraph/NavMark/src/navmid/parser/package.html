This package implements the parsing of result file from navstatic (previous version used Matos).
These are XML files where we can identify three parts:
<ul>
<li> identification of abstract nodes representing live objects allocated in a given context.
<li> relations established between abstract nodes. This analysis is the result of a points-to
analysis on identified methods
<li> callback analysis where control flow is locally explored.
</ul>
