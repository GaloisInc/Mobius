This component is organized as a serie of applications:
* NavStatic:
    extract from a midlet all the relations necessary to compute the navigationi graph:
	- abstraction of UI objects
	- relation between UI objects (points-to analysis)
	- 
     uses Soot (soot2.3)
     This component can be seen as a very reduced version of Matos
* NavInliner
     A small utility for modifying jar files. To be used with NavTag
* NavTag
     Instruments the code of a midlet so that it can send signals as relevant
     events occur.
* NavMark
     Generation of the navigation graph and animation of an execution.

Usage
=====
We have a midlet defined by its jad toto.jad and its jar toto.jar
Instrument with
  navmod.sh toto
Now we have toto-mod.jar and toto-mod.jad
We analyze it with
  navstatic.sh toto.jar
We obtain toto.xml
We install a connector for the serial line emulation
  serial_install.sh (as root)
We launch the navigation graph
  navmark.sh toto
We launch the MIDP emulator on the modified midlet.
  ${WTK}/bin/emulator -Xdescripto:toto-mod.jad
We use the midlet to explore all the paths.
