This file contains detected bmllib problems.

1. duplicates in local variables names. The getLocalVariable(String name) 
method in BCMethod does not support case of duplicates in local variable names 
(loops has mostly local control variables that can have the same name in different
loops)

2. If an local variable is declared, but not initialized, it won't be found by 
getLocalVariable(String name) in BCMethod.

3. kjk: Probably BmlLib should give API for checking type of operator - 
what type of node it should return and what parameter types are aplicable
Now we have something like it in jml2bml.bmllib

4. kjk: When building expressions Bml should check if parameters aren't null??

5. kjk: Maybe it should be possible to add it. Assert annotation as
the last to the instruction handle - now it must be made around
(get list of annotations at handle, it's size ??)
