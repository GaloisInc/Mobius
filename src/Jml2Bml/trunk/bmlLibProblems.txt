This file contains detected bmllib problems.

1. duplicates in local variables names. The getLocalVariable(String name) 
method in BCMethod does not support case of duplicates in local variable names 
(loops has mostly local control variables that can have the same name in different
loops)

2. If an local variable is declared, but not initialized, it won't be found by 
getLocalVariable(String name) in BCMethod.
