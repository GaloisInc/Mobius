BON Software Model Consistency Checker for Eclipse

Abstract

Modelling languages specifying a system independently from its 
implementation are particularly useful during analysis and design stages
of a system. An implementation-specific formal language translates those 
requirements directly into code, annotations and possibly assertions. 
Both approaches have their advantages and should ideally be used hand 
in hand. In practice however, mostly due to lack of tool support, the 
model of a project will not be updated once a formal specification is 
in place, thus rendering it useless. This project interlinks the BON and
JML modelling languages by creating a mapping between their structure 
and assertion features and by providing tool support for consistency 
checking.
