@book{chalin06jml,
	Abstract = {Many state-based specification languages, including the Java Modeling Language (JML), contain at their core specification constructs familiar to most undergraduates: e.g., assertions, pre- and postconditions, and invariants. Unfortunately, these constructs are not sufficiently expressive to permit formal modular verification of programs written in modern object-oriented languages like Java. The necessary extra constructs for specifying an object-oriented module include (perhaps the less familiar) frame properties, datagroups, and ghost and model fields. These constructs help specifiers deal with potential problems related to, for example, unexpected side effects, aliasing, class invariants, inheritance, and lack of information hiding. This tutorial paper focuses on JML's realization of these constructs, explaining their meaning while illustrating how they can be used to address the stated problems.},

@inproceedings{litvak03behavioralUML,
	Abstract = {UML provides several kinds of diagrams to model the behavior and structure of a system under development. A consistency problem may arise due to the fact that some aspects of the model may be described by more than one diagram. Hence, it is important that the consistency of the system description should be checked before implementing it. This paper describes an algorithmic approach to a consistency check between UML sequence and state diagrams. The algorithm we provide also handles complex state diagrams, e.g. diagrams that include forks, joins, and concurrent composite states. We describe the algorithm in detail, and elaborate on the design decisions made while developing the algorithm. We have implemented BVUML, a tool that assists in automating the validation process.},

@article{paige07consistencycheck,
	Abstract = {Model-driven development, using languages such as UML and BON, often makes use of multiple diagrams (e.g., class and sequence diagrams) when modeling systems. These diagrams, presenting different views of a system of interest, may be inconsistent. A metamodel provides a unifying framework in which to ensure and check consistency, while at the same time providing the means to distinguish between valid and invalid models, that is, conformance. Two formal specifications of the metamodel for an object-oriented modeling language are presented, and it is shown how to use these specifications for model conformance and multiview consistency checking. Comparisons are made in terms of completeness and the level of automation each provide for checking multiview consistency and model conformance. The lessons learned from applying formal techniques to the problems of metamodeling, model conformance, and multiview consistency checking are summarized.},

	Abstract = {The Java Modeling Language (JML) can be used to specify the detailed design of Java classes and interfaces by adding annotations to Java source files. The aim of JML is to provide a specification language that is easy to use for Java programmers and that is supported by a wide range of tools for specification type-checking, runtime debugging, static analysis, and verification.},
