Mobius ESC/Java2 Plugin User Interface 2.0.6

Release date:

The pluginlib has been moved into its own plugin so that it can be re-used
across all mobius plugins.

The preference page now allows a different set of specifications and 
bootclasspath to be used for different variants of Java e.g. JavaCard or MIDP.
