BMLLib library. Package annot.attributes.
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
The package represents the BML attributes and provides procedures to
load and save them to class files. The top-level package contains
classes and interfaces which represent generic functionality of attributes.
We have here:
<ul>
  <li>{@see AttributeNames} - the class with string representations of all the
    attribute names used in the project</li>
  <li>{@see AType} - a container for flags that allow to retrieve
      different kinds of attributes from their containers (e.g. class,
      method or field)</li>
  <li>{@see BCAttributeTable} - a representation of tables of attributes</li>
  <li>{@see BCPrintableAttribute} - an abstract class with methods to parse
      and print attributes</li>
  <li>{@see IBCAttribute} - an interface which should be implemented by all
      BML attributes</li>
</ul>

<p>
This package contains subpackages which divide the space of existing
attributes based on their location within a class.
</p>

<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
<p>
The subpackages of annot.attributes are:
<ul>
  <li> {@see annot.attributes.clazz} - attributes located in the
    attribute area for a class</li>
  <li> {@see annot.attributes.field} - attributes located in the
    attribute area within a field representation</li>
  <li> {@see annot.attributes.method} - attributes located in the
    attribute area within a method representation</li>
</ul>
