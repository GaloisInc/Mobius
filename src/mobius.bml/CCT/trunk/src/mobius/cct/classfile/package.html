<h2>Class files</h2>
<p>Classes are represented as objects implementing the 
{@link mobius.cct.classfile.ClassFile ClassFile} interface. 
A default implementation 
({@link mobius.cct.classfile.DefaultClassFile} DefaultClassFile), 
which does not depend on any external library, is provided. 
However, is some cases it might be better to use ClassFiles based on 
a library like BCEL or ASM. For this reason most repository classes are 
generics parameterized with type of ClassFiles.</p>

<p>If an implementation of class file can be used to modify and write classes, 
it should implement the {@link mobius.cct.classfile.MutableClassFile MutableClassFile}
interface.</p>

<h2>Visitors</h2>
<p>Class files expose their attributes by calling appropriate methods of a 
{@link mobius.cct.classfile.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor} object. This interface 
is similar to that used by ASM bytecode library or SAX API for XML. All visitor 
methods may throw an exception of type VisitorException, which is usually used
to wrap another type of exception.</p>
<p>Mutable class files can create a visitor which can be used to set their
attributes and save resulting class to a stream.</p>

<h2>Parsing class files</h2>
<p>Generic {@link mobius.cct.repositories.Repository Repository} 
implementations (able to read any type of 
{@link mobius.cct.classfile.ClassFile ClassFile}) must be 
supplied with an object which can be used to parse a byte stream and 
create right kind of {@link mobius.cct.classfile.ClassFile ClassFile}. 
{@link mobius.cct.classfile.ClassReader ClassReader} is the interface 
of such objects. Their input is given as a 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.Resource Resource} object. Resources are simply
byte streams which can be opened and closed.</p>

<h2>Certificate files</h2>
<p>Separate certificates are represented as class files with
structure similar to the file they certify. They can store not
only certificates, but also other information, such as BML or
other type of specification not contained in the certificate.
