<p>
This library implements a verification framework for proof-carrying code.
It can be used to process class files which contain certificates encoded
as attributes. Certificates can also be stored in separate files. CCT API, 
which is documented here, contains classes which can be used to read and 
write class files with certificates, define methods of verification and
control the verification process.
</p>
<h2>Locating classes</h2>
<p>
Class files can be read from various sources (filesystem, network, ...).
An object that can locate and read them is called a repository.
Repositories are implemented in package {@link mobius.cct.repositories}. 
</p>

<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>
Verification process is managed by an object called environment.
An object which performs the actual verification of a certificate is
called a plugin or verifier. Environments, plugins and methods of 
verification are discussed in documentation of 
{@link mobius.cct.verifiers} package.
