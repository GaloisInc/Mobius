<p>
This package contains objects used to manipulate classpaths - 
sequences of directories/zip files from which classes are read.
</p>
<h2>Certificate files</h2>
<p>Separate certificate files can also be read from classpaths
- they should be located in the same directory as the class they 
certify and have identical name, but with extension cert instead of
class.
