in the bytecode Umbra editor. This package contains two subpackages:
</p>
<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
<ul>
   <li> {@see umbra.editor.actions.history} which contains actions related to
        the handling of the historical versions of a byte code file.</li>
   <li> {@see umbra.editor.actions.info} which contains actions related to
        the help information i.e. how to install the Umbra plug-in and
        how to use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The package itself contains the following classes to handle the byte code
aditor actions:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> {@see BytecodeColorAction} which handles the actions that change the
        colouring mode.</li>
   <li> {@see BytecodeCombineAction} which handles the action that combines
        the changes.</li>
   <li> {@see BytecodeRebuildAction} which handles the action that retrieves
        back the original, unedited version of the currently edited file.</li>
   <li> {@see BytecodeRefreshAction} which handles the action that saves the
        current edits and reformats the current document in the default
        fashion.</li>
   <li> {@see BytecodeSynchrAction} which handles the action to move from the
        byte code program point to corresponding point in the source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
All these actions share certain functionality which is implemented in their
common superclass {@see BytecodeEditorAction}.
