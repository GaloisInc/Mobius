Umbra plugin. Package umbra.editor.actions.history
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
This package contains all the classes which handle the GUI actions available
in the bytecode Umbra editor and which handle the access to the historical
versions of a bytecode file.

The package handles the actions:
<ul>
  <li>To add an item to the history {@see HistoryAction}</li>
  <li>To get an item from the history {@see BytecodeRestoreAction}</li>
  <li>To clear the history concerning the currently edited file
      {@see ClearHistoryAction}</li>
</ul>

The history is organised in files. In case we add an item to the history,
the current file name.btc is copied to name.bt&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is the
number of the first free history item. Moreover, the current file name.class
is copied to name.class&lt;num&gt;. The logic is implemented in
umbra.lib.HistoryOperations.
