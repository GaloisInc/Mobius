<body bgcolor="white">
The umbra.instructions package contains the classes which handle the parsing
of the text files obtained from BCEL (through BMLlib). This functionality is
used to check if the byte code text modifications give rise to correct byte
code. This package uses the abstract syntax tree placed in
umbra.instructions.ast.
