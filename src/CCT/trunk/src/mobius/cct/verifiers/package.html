This package contains verifiers framework and built-in verifiers.

<h2>Certificates and specifications</h2>
<p>
Certificates and specifications are two fundamental concepts in
the verification framework presented below. A certificate is stored
in <tt>.class</tt> file as an attribute. That attribute contains 
certificate type (a string and version number). Each certificate
proves one or more specifications. The specifications also have a 
type, but there is no standardized way to store them in a 
<tt>.class</tt> file. They may be embedded in certificates, 
represented by separate attributes or inferred from bytecode.
To find out which types of specification exist in a class file
one has to read all its certificates, find verification plugins 
and query the plugins (using 
{@link mobius.cct.verifiers.Verifier#getSpecificationType()}

} method).
</p>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>
An object that can be used to verify correctness of a certificate
is called a plugin. All plugins implement the 
{@link mobius.cct.verifiers.Verifier} interface. Each plugin 
must declare type of certificates which can be verified
by it. It should be able to check correctness of all certificates
of this type and know the type of specifications proved by them.
</p>
<h2>Environments</h2>
<p>
Environments (objects implementing the 
{@link mobius.cct.verifiers.Environment Environment} interface)
are used to manage the verification process. They implement the 
{@link mobius.cct.verifiers.Environment#verify(ClassName, String) verify()} 
method,  which can be used to verify a specification of a class. 
This method is responsible for locating the class, finding a certificate
that can be used to prove the requested specification and running
a plugin to verify it. The environment is also used to give plugins
the ability to load classes and verify specifications required by
the certificate which is being checked. It can also provide some
other services, such as {@link mobius.cct.verifiers.logging logging}.
</p>

<h2>Trusted classes</h2>
<p>
System library classes usually do not need to be verified. However,
other classes are likely to depend on them, so the environment is
often requested to validate their specifications. For this reason
default implementation of environment 
({@link mobius.cct.verifiers.DefaultEnvironment DefaultEnvironment})
maintains a list of trusted classes. Verification of such a class is
always successful and does not require locating, loading and parsing
it.
