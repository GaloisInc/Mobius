<p>This package contains classes related to repositories - objects used 
to read class and certificate files.</p>

<h2>Class files</h2>
<p>Classes are represented as objects implementing the 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.classfile.ClassFile ClassFile} interface. 
A default implementation 
({@link mobius.cct.repositories.classfile.DefaultClassFile} DefaultClassFile), 
which does not depend on any external library, is provided. 
However, is some cases it might be better to use ClassFiles based on 
a library like BCEL or ASM. For this reason most repository classes are 
generics parameterized with type of ClassFiles.</p>

<p>If an implementation of class file can be used to modify and write classes, 
it should implement the {@link mobius.cct.repositories.classfile.MutableClassFile MutableClassFile}
interface.</p>

<h2>Repositories</h2>
<p>A repository is a class which implements the 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.Repository Repository} interface. 
This interface is very simple and has only two methods - one for reading
classes and another for reading separate certificate files. 
Default implementation 
({@link mobius.cct.repositories.DefaultRepository DefaultRepository}) 
loads all files from the system classpath. It also uses a cache to avoid reading 
the same file again. It is possible to add this feature to a custom 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.Repository Repository} by using
class {@link mobius.cct.repositories.CachedRepository CachedRepository}.</p>

<h2>Parsing class files</h2>
<p>Generic {@link mobius.cct.repositories.Repository Repository} 
implementations (able to read any type of 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.classfile.ClassFile ClassFile}) must be 
supplied with an object which can be used to parse a byte stream and 
create right kind of {@link mobius.cct.repositories.classfile.ClassFile ClassFile}. 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.classfile.ClassReader ClassReader} is the interface 
of such objects. Their input is given as a 
{@link mobius.cct.repositories.Resource Resource} object. Resources are simply
byte streams which can be opened and closed.</p>

<h2>Certificate files</h2>
<p>Separate certificates are represented as class files with
structure similar to the file they certify. They can store not
only certificates, but also other information, such as BML or
other type of specification not contained in the certificate.
