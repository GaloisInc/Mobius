<h1 class="chapter"> 1. Introduction </h1>

<p>JML is a notation for formally specifying
the behavior and interfaces of Java [Arnold-Gosling-Holmes00] [Gosling-etal00]
classes and methods.
</p>
<a name="IDX1"></a>
<a name="IDX2"></a>
<a name="IDX3"></a>
<a name="IDX4"></a>
<p>The goal of this reference manual is to precisely record the design of
JML.  We include both informal semantics (intentions) and where possible
[[[we will eventually include]]]
formal semantics (describing when an implementation satisfies a
specification). We also discuss the implications for various tools
(such as the run-time assertion checker, static checkers such as ESC/Java2, and
documentation generators such as jmldoc [Burdy-etal03]).

<a name="IDX6"></a>
<a name="IDX7"></a>
<a name="IDX8"></a>
<a name="IDX9"></a>
<a name="IDX10"></a>
<p>In this manual we also try to give examples and explanations, and we
hope that these will 
be helpful to readers trying to learn about formal specification using
JML.
However, this manual is not designed to give all the background needed
to write JML specifications, nor to give the prospective user an
overview of a useful subset of the language.
For this background, we recommend starting with
the papers &ldquo;Design by Contract with JML&rdquo;
[Leavens-Cheon06]
and &ldquo;JML: A notation for detailed design&rdquo;
[Leavens-Baker-Ruby99], and continuing with the
paper &ldquo;Preliminary Design of JML&rdquo; [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06].
These are all available from the JML web site
&lsquo;<tt>http://www.jmlspecs.org/</tt>&rsquo;, where further readings and examples
may also be found.
</p>
<p>Readers with the necessary background,
and users wanting more details may, we hope, profit from reading this manual.
We suggest reading this manual starting with chapters 1-3,
skimming chapter 4 quickly,
skimming chapter 5 to get the idea of what declarations mean in JML,
and then reading the chapters on class specifications (chapter 6)
and method specifications (chapter 7),
paying particular attention to the examples.
After that, one can use the rest of this manual as a reference.
</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter describes some of the fundamental ideas and
background behind JML.

<h2 class="section"> 1.1 Behavioral Interface Specifications </h2>

<p>JML is a <em>behavioral interface specification language</em> (BISL)
that builds on the Larch approach [Guttag-Horning93] [Guttag-Horning-Wing85b]
and that found in APP [Rosenblum95] and Eiffel [Meyer92b] [Meyer97].
In this style of specification,
which might be called model-oriented [Wing90a],
one specifies both the interface of a method or abstract data type
and its behavior [Lamport89].
In particular JML builds on the work done by Leavens and others in Larch/C++
[Leavens-Baker99] [Leavens96b] [Leavens97c].
(Indeed, large parts of this manual are adapted wholesale from
the Larch/C++ reference manual [Leavens97c].)
Much of JML's design was heavily influenced by the work of Leino and his
collaborators [Leino95] [Leino95b] [Leino98] [Leino-etal00]
[Leino-Nelson-Saxe00]. 
JML continues to be influenced by ongoing work in formal
specification and verification.
A collection of papers relating directly to JML and its design is
found at 
&lsquo;<tt>http://www.jmlspecs.org/papers.shtml</tt>&rsquo;.
</p>
<a name="IDX11"></a>
<a name="IDX12"></a>
<a name="IDX13"></a>
<a name="IDX14"></a>
<p>The <em>interface</em> of the method or type is
the information needed to use it from other programs.  In the case of
JML, this is the Java syntax and type information needed to call a
method or use a field or type.  For a method the interface 
includes such things as the name of the method, its modifiers
(including its visibility and whether it is final)
its number of arguments, its return type, what exceptions it may
throw, and so on. 
For a field the interface includes its name and type, and its modifiers.
For a type, the interface
includes its name, its modifiers, its package, whether it is a class
or interface, its supertypes, and the interfaces of the fields and methods it
declares and inherits.
JML specifies all such interface information using Java's syntax.
</p>
<a name="IDX15"></a>
<a name="IDX16"></a>
<a name="IDX17"></a>
<a name="IDX18"></a>
<a name="IDX19"></a>
<a name="IDX20"></a>
<a name="IDX21"></a>
<p>A <em>behavior</em> of a method or type describes a set of state
transformations that it can perform.
A behavior of a method is specified by describing:
a set of states in which calling the method is defined,
a set of locations that the method is allowed to assign to (and hence change),
and the relations between the calling state and
the state in which it either returns normally, throws an exception,
or for which it might not return to the caller.
The states for which the method is defined are formally described by
a logical assertion, called the method's <em>precondition</em>.
The allowed relationships between these states
and the states that may result from normal return are formally described
by another logical assertion called the method's <em>normal postcondition</em>.
Similarly the relationships between these pre-states
and the states that may result from throwing an exception
are described by the method's <em>exceptional postcondition</em>.
The states for which the method need not return to the caller are
described by the method's <em>divergence condition</em>; however,
explicit specification of divergence is rarely used in JML.
The set of locations the method is allowed to assign to
is described by the method's <em>frame axiom</em> [Borgida-etal95].
In JML one can also specify other aspects of behavior, such as the
time a method can use to execute and the space it may need.

<a name="IDX30"></a>
<a name="IDX31"></a>
<a name="IDX32"></a>
<a name="IDX33"></a>
<p>The behavior of an abstract data type (ADT), which is implemented by a
class in Java, is specified by describing a set of abstract fields for
its objects and by specifying the behavior of its methods (as described
above).  The abstract fields for an object can be specified either by
using JML's model and ghost fields [Cheon-etal05], which are
specification-only fields, or by specifying some of the fields used in
the implementation as <code>spec_public</code> or <code>spec_protected</code>.
These declarations allow the specifier using JML to model an
instance as a collection of abstract instance variables,
in much the same way as other specification languages, such as Z [Hayes93]
[Spivey92] or Fresco [Wills92b].

<h2 class="section"> 1.2 A First Example </h2>

<p>For example, consider the following JML specification
of a simple Java abstract class <code>IntHeap</code>. (An explanation of
the notation follows the specification.  This specification, like the
others in this manual, ships with the JML release in the
&lsquo;<tt>JML/org/jmlspecs/samples/jmlrefman</tt>&rsquo; directory.)

<p>The interface of this class consists of lines 1, 3, 15, and 18.
Line 3 specifies the class name, and the fact that the class
is both public and abstract. Lines 15 and 18, apart from their comments,
give the interface information for the methods of this class.
</p>
<a name="IDX35"></a>
<a name="IDX36"></a>

<a name="IDX38"></a>
<a name="IDX39"></a>
<a name="IDX40"></a>
<a name="IDX41"></a>
<p>The behavior of this class is specified in the JML annotations found
in the special comments that have an at-sign (<code>@</code>) as their
first character following the usual comment beginning.
Such lines look like comments to Java, but are interpreted by JML and
its tools.
For example, line 5 starts with an annotation comment marker of the form
<code>//@</code>, and this annotation continues until the <code>//</code> towards
the end of the line, which starts a comment within the annotation
which even JML ignores.
The other form of such annotations can be seen on lines 7 through 14,
line 17, and on lines 15 and 18.
These annotations start with the characters <code>/*@</code>
and end with either <code>@*/</code> or <code>*/</code>; within such annotations,
at-signs (<code>@</code>) at the beginnings of lines are ignored by JML.
Note that there can be no space between the start of comment marker,
either <code>//</code> or <code>/*</code> and the first at-sign;
thus <code>// @</code> starts a comment, not an annotation.
(See section <a href="jmlrefman_4.html#SEC25">Lexical Conventions</a>, for more details about annotations.)
</p>
<a name="IDX42"></a>
<p>The first annotation, on line 5 of the figure above,
gives the specification of a field,
named <code>elements</code>, which is part of this class's behavioral specification.
Ignoring, for the moment the extra JML modifiers,
one should think of this field, in essence, as being declared like:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">   public int[] elements;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>That is, it is a public field with an integer array type;
within specifications it is treated as such.
However, because it is declared in an annotation, this field cannot be
manipulated by Java code.  Therefore, for example, the fact that the
field is declared public is not a problem, because it cannot be
directly changed by Java code.
</p>
<a name="IDX43"></a>
<a name="IDX44"></a>
<a name="IDX45"></a>
<p>Such declarations of fields in annotations should be marked as
specification-only fields, using the JML modifier
<code>model</code>.<a name="DOCF1" href="jmlrefman_fot.html#FOOT1">(1)</a>
A model field should be thought of as an abstraction of a set of concrete
fields used in the implementation of this type and its subtypes.
(See section <a href="jmlrefman_8.html#SEC74">Represents Clauses</a>, for a discussion of how to specify the
connection between the concrete fields and such model fields.  See also
the paper by Cheon et al. [Cheon-etal05].) That is, we imagine that
objects that are instances of the type <code>IntHeap</code> have such a field,
whose value is determined by the concrete fields that are known to Java
in the actual object.  Of course at runtime, objects of type
<code>IntHeap</code> have no such field, the model fields are purely
imaginary.  Model fields are thus a convenient fiction that is useful
for describing the behavior of an ADT.  One does not have to worry about
their cost (in space or time), and should only be concerned with how
they clarify the behavior of an ADT.
</p>
<a name="IDX46"></a>
<p>The other annotation used on line 5 is <code>non_null</code>.
This just says that in any publicly-visible
state, the value of <code>elements</code> must not be <code>null</code>.
It is thus a simple kind of invariant (see section <a href="jmlrefman_8.html#SEC65">Invariants</a>).
</p>
<a name="IDX47"></a>
<a name="IDX48"></a>
<p>In the above specification of <code>IntHeap</code>,
the specification of each method precedes its interface declaration.
This follows the usual convention of Java tools, such as JavaDoc,
which put such descriptive information in front of the method.  In
JML, it is also possible to put the specification just before the
semicolon (<code>;</code>) following the method's interface information
(see section <a href="jmlrefman_9.html#SEC80">Method Specifications</a>), but
we will usually not to do that in this document.
</p>
<a name="IDX49"></a>
<a name="IDX50"></a>
<a name="IDX51"></a>
<a name="IDX52"></a>
<p>The specification of the method <code>largest</code> is given on lines 7
through 15. Line 7 says that this is a public, normal behavior specification.
JML permits several different specifications for a given method,
which can be of different privacy levels [Ruby-Leavens00] [Leavens-Mueller07].
The modifier <code>public</code> says that the specification is intended for
use by clients.
(If the privacy modifier had been
<code>protected</code>, for example,
then the specification would have been intended for subclasses.)
</p>
<a name="IDX53"></a>
<a name="IDX54"></a>
<a name="IDX55"></a>
<a name="IDX56"></a>
<a name="IDX57"></a>
<a name="IDX58"></a>
<p>The keyword <code>normal_behavior</code> tells JML several things.
First, it says that the specification is a heavyweight
method specification, as opposed to a lightweight method specification
like that given on line 17.
A <em>heavyweight</em> specification uses one of JML's behavior keywords,
like <code>normal_behavior</code>, which tells JML that the method
specification is intended to be complete.  By contrast, a
<em>lightweight</em> specification does not use one of JML's behavior
keywords, and tells JML that the specification is incomplete in the
sense that it contains only some of what the specifier had in mind.<a name="DOCF2" href="jmlrefman_fot.html#FOOT2">(2)</a>
Second, the keyword <code>normal_behavior</code> tells JML that when the
precondition of this method is met, then the method must return
normally, without throwing an exception. In other words, it says that
the exceptional postcondition is <code>false</code>, which prohibits the
method from throwing an exception when the precondition holds.
(Third, it says that the divergence condition defaults to <code>false</code>.
See section <a href="jmlrefman_9.html#SEC80">Method Specifications</a>, for more details.)
</p>
<a name="IDX59"></a>
<a name="IDX60"></a>
<a name="IDX61"></a>
<a name="IDX62"></a>
<a name="IDX63"></a>
<a name="IDX64"></a>
<a name="IDX65"></a>
<p>The heart of the method specification of <code>largest</code> is found on
lines 7 through 13.  This part of the specification gives the method's
precondition, on line 8, frame axiom, on line 9, and normal postcondition, on
lines 10 through 13.  The precondition is contained in the
<code>requires</code> clause on line 8.  The frame axiom is contained in the
<code>assignable</code> clause on line 9.  The normal postcondition is
contained in the <code>ensures</code> clause on lines 10-13.<a name="DOCF3" href="jmlrefman_fot.html#FOOT3">(3)</a>
</p>
<a name="IDX66"></a>
<p>The precondition in the requires clause on line 8 says that the length of
<code>elements</code> must be at least 1 before this method can be called.
If that is not true, then the method is under no obligation to fulfill
the rest of the specified behavior.
</p>
<a name="IDX67"></a>
<a name="IDX68"></a>
<a name="IDX69"></a>
<a name="IDX70"></a>
<a name="IDX71"></a>
<p>The frame axiom in the assignable clause on line 9 says that the method may not
assign to any locations (i.e. fields of objects) that are visible
outside the method and which existed before the method started
execution.  (The method may still modify its local variables.)  This
form of the frame axiom is quite common.<a name="DOCF4" href="jmlrefman_fot.html#FOOT4">(4)</a>
Note that in assignable clauses and in assertions, JML
uses keywords that start with a backslash (<code>\</code>), to avoid
interfering with identifiers in the user's program.  Examples of this
are <code>\nothing</code> on line 9 and <code>\result</code> on line 10.
</p>
<a name="IDX72"></a>
<a name="IDX73"></a>
<a name="IDX74"></a>
<a name="IDX75"></a>
<a name="IDX76"></a>
<a name="IDX77"></a>
<a name="IDX78"></a>
<p>The postcondition in the ensures clause, on lines 10 through 13,
says that the result of the method (<code>\result</code>)
must be equal to the maximum integer found in the array
<code>elements</code>.
This postcondition uses JML's <code>\max</code> quantifier (lines 11 through
13).  Such a quantifier is always parenthesized, and can consist of
three parts.  The first part of a quantifier
is a declaration of some quantified variables,
in this case the integer <code>j</code> on line 11.
The second part is a <em>range predicate</em>, on line 12,
which constrains the quantified variables.  The third part is the <em>body</em> of
the quantifier, on line 13, which in this case describes the elements
of the array from which the maximum value is taken.
</p>
<a name="IDX79"></a>
<p>The methods <code>largest</code> and <code>size</code> are both specified
using the JML modifier <code>pure</code>.  This modifier says that the
method has no side effects, and allows the method to be used in
assertions if desired.
</p>
<a name="IDX80"></a>
<p>The method <code>size</code> is specified using a lightweight
specification, which is given on line 17.  
The ensures clause on line 17 says nothing about the precondition,
frame axiom, exceptional postcondition, or divergence condition of <code>size</code>,
although the use of <code>pure</code> on line 18 gives an implicit frame
axiom.  Such a form of specification is useful when one only cares to
state (the important) part of a method's specification.
It is also useful when first learning JML, and when one is using tools,
such as ESC/Java2, that do not need heavyweight specifications.
</p>
<a name="IDX81"></a>
<a name="IDX82"></a>
<a name="IDX83"></a>
<a name="IDX84"></a>
<p>The specifications of the method <code>largest</code> above is
very precise: it gives a complete specification of what the method does. 
Even the specification of <code>size</code> has a fairly complete normal
postcondition.
We can also give JML specifications that are far less detailed.
For example, we could just specify that the result of <code>size</code> is
non-negative, with a normal postcondition such as
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example"> //@ ensures \result &gt;= 0;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>instead of the postcondition given earlier.
Such incomplete specifications give considerably more freedom to
implementations, and can often be useful for hiding implementation
details.
However, one should try to write specifications that capture the important
properties expected of callers (preconditions) and implementations
(postconditions) [Meyer92a] [Liskov-Guttag86].

<h2 class="section"> 1.3 What is JML Good For? </h2>


<p>JML is a formal specification language tailored to Java.
Its basic use is thus the formal specification of
the behavior of Java program modules.
As it is a behavioral interface specification language,
JML specifies how to use such Java program modules from
<em>within</em> a Java program; hence JML is <em>not</em> designed
for specifying the behavior of an entire program.
So the question &ldquo;what is JML good for?&rdquo; really boils down to
the following question: what good is formal specification
for Java program modules?
</p>
<a name="IDX85"></a>
<a name="IDX86"></a>
<p>The two main benefits in using JML are:
</p><ul>
<li>
the precise, unambiguous specification
of the behavior of Java program modules (i.e., classes and interfaces),
and documentation of Java code,

</li><li>
the possibility of tool support [Burdy-etal03].
</li></ul>

<a name="IDX87"></a>
<a name="IDX88"></a>
<a name="IDX89"></a>
<a name="IDX90"></a>
<p>Although we would like tools that would help with reasoning about
concurrent aspects of Java programs, the current version of JML
focuses on the sequential behavior of Java code.
While there is work in progress on extending JML to support
concurrency, the current version of JML does not have features that help
specify how Java threads interact with each other.
JML does not, for example, allow the specification of elaborate
temporal properties, such as coordinated access to shared variables or the
absence of deadlock.  Indeed, we assume, in the rest of this manual, that
there is only one thread of execution in a Java program annotated with
JML, and we focus on how the program manipulates object states.  To summarize,
JML is currently limited to sequential specification; we say that JML
specifies the <em>sequential behavior</em> of Java program modules.
</p>
<p>In terms of detailed design documentation,
a JML specification can be a completely formal contract about
an interface and its sequential behavior.
Because it is an interface specification,
one can record all the Java details about the interface,
such as the parameter mechanisms, whether the method is <code>final</code>,
<code>protected</code>, etc.;
if one used a specification language such as VDM-SL or Z,
which is not tailored to Java, then one could not record such details
of the interface, which could cause problems in code integration.
For example, in JML one can specify the precise conditions under
which certain exceptions may be thrown, something which is difficult
in a specification language that is not tailored to Java and that
doesn't have the notion of an exception.
</p>
<a name="IDX91"></a>
<a name="IDX92"></a>
<a name="IDX93"></a>
<p>When should JML documentation be written?
That is up to you, the user.
A goal of JML is to make the notation indifferent to the precise
programming method used.
One can use JML either before coding or as documentation of finished code.
While we recommend doing some design before
coding, JML can also be used for documentation after the code is written.
</p>
<a name="IDX94"></a>
<a name="IDX95"></a>
<a name="IDX96"></a>
<a name="IDX97"></a>
<p>Reasons for formal documentation of interfaces and their
behavior, using JML, include the following.
</p><ul>
<li>
One can ship the object code for a class library to customers,
sending the JML specifications but not the source code.
Customers would then have documentation that is precise,
unambiguous, but not overly specific.
Customers would not have the code, protecting proprietary rights.
In addition, customers would not rely on details of the implementation
of the library that they might otherwise glean from the code,
easing the process of improving the code in future releases.

</li><li>
<a name="IDX98"></a>
<a name="IDX99"></a>
<a name="IDX100"></a>
One can use a formal specification to analyze certain properties of
a design carefully or formally
(see [Hall90] and Chapter 7 of [Guttag-Horning93]).
In general, the act of formally specifying a program module has
salutary effects on the quality of the design.

</li><li>
<a name="IDX101"></a>
<a name="IDX102"></a>
<a name="IDX103"></a>
One can use the JML specification as an aid to careful reasoning
about the correctness of code, or even for formal verification
[Huisman01] [Jacobs-Poll01] [Ruby06].

</li><li>
<a name="IDX104"></a>
JML specifications can be used by several tools that can help debug
and improve the code [Burdy-etal03].
</li></ul>

<a name="IDX105"></a>
<a name="IDX106"></a>
<a name="IDX107"></a>
<a name="IDX108"></a>
<p>There is one additional benefit from using JML.
It is that JML allows one to record not just public interfaces
and behavior, but also some detailed design decisions.
That is, in JML, one can specify not just the public
interface of a Java class,
but also behavior of a class's protected and private interfaces.
Formally documenting a base class's protected interface
and &ldquo;subclassing contract&rdquo;
allows programmers to implement derived
classes of such a base class without looking at its code
[Ruby-Leavens00] [Ruby06].
</p>
<p>Recording the private interface of a class may be helpful
in program development or maintenance.
Usually one would expect that the public interface of a class would
be specified, and then separate, more refined specifications would
be given for use by derived classes and for detailed implementation
(and friend classes).
(See section <a href="jmlrefman_16.html#SEC193">Refinement</a>, for how to record each level in JML.)
</p>
<a name="IDX109"></a>
<a name="IDX110"></a>
<a name="IDX111"></a>
<a name="IDX112"></a>
<p>The reader may also wish to consult
the &ldquo;Preliminary Design of JML&rdquo; [Leavens-Baker-Ruby06]
for a discussion of the goals that are behind JML's design.
Apart from the improved precision in the specifications and
documentation of code, the main advantage of using a formal specification 
language, as opposed to informal natural language, is the possibility of 
tool support.
One specific goal that has emerged over time is that JML should be
able to unify several different tool-building efforts in the area of
formal methods.  
</p>
<a name="IDX113"></a>
<a name="IDX114"></a>
<a name="IDX115"></a>
<a name="IDX116"></a>
<a name="IDX117"></a>
<a name="IDX118"></a>
<p>The most basic tool support for JML &ndash; simply parsing and typechecking &ndash;
is already useful.
Whereas informal comments in code are typically not kept up to date
as the code is changed, the simple act of running the typechecker
will catch any JML assertions referring to parameter or field names 
that no longer exist, and all other typos of course.
Enforcing the visibility rules can also provide useful feedback;
for example, a precondition of a <code>public</code> method which refers
to a <code>private</code> field of an object is suspect.
</p>
<a name="IDX119"></a>
<a name="IDX120"></a>
<a name="IDX121"></a>
<a name="IDX122"></a>
<a name="IDX123"></a>

<a name="IDX125"></a>

<a name="IDX127"></a>
<a name="IDX128"></a>
<a name="IDX129"></a>
<a name="IDX130"></a>
<a name="IDX131"></a>
<p>Of course, there are more exciting forms of tool support than just 
parsing and typechecking.  In particular JML is designed to support static
analysis (as in ESC/Java [Leino-etal00]), formal verification
(as in the LOOP tool [Huisman01] [Jacobs-etal98]),
recording of dynamically obtained invariants (as in Daikon [Ernst-etal01]),
runtime assertion checking (as in JML's runtime assertion checker,
jmlc [Cheon-Leavens02b] [Cheon03]), unit testing [Cheon-Leavens02],
and documentation (as in JML's jmldoc tool).
The paper by Burdy et al.&nbsp;[Burdy-etal03] is a recent survey of tools
for JML.
The utility of these tools is the ultimate answer to the question of
what JML is good for.

<h2 class="section"> 1.5 Historical Precedents </h2>

<p>JML combines ideas from Eiffel [Meyer92a] [Meyer92b] [Meyer97]
with ideas from model-based specification languages such as
VDM [Jones90] and the Larch family
[Guttag-Horning93] [LeavensLarchFAQ] [Wing87] [Wing90a].
It also adds some ideas from the refinement calculus
[Back88] [Back-vonWright89a] [Back-vonWright98] [Morgan-Vickers94] [Morgan94]
(see section <a href="jmlrefman_16.html#SEC193">Refinement</a>).
In this section we describe the advantages and disadvantages
of these approaches.
Readers unfamiliar with these historical precedents may want to skip
this section.
</p>
<a name="IDX138"></a>
<a name="IDX139"></a>
<a name="IDX140"></a>

<a name="IDX143"></a>
<a name="IDX144"></a>
<a name="IDX145"></a>
<a name="IDX146"></a>
<p>Formal, model-based languages such as those typified by the
Larch family build on ideas found originally in Hoare's work.
Hoare used pre- and postconditions to describe the semantics of computer
programs in his famous article [Hoare69].
Later Hoare adapted these axiomatic techniques to the specification
and correctness proofs of abstract data types [Hoare72a].
To specify an ADT, Hoare described a mathematical set of abstract values
for the type, and then specified pre- and postconditions for each of the
operations of the type in terms of how the abstract values of objects
were affected.
For example, one might specify a class <code>IntHeap</code>
using abstract values of the form <code>empty</code> and <code>add(i,h)</code>,
where <code>i</code> is an <code>int</code> and <code>h</code> is an <code>IntHeap</code>.
These notations form a mathematical vocabulary used in the rest of the
specification.
</p>
<a name="IDX147"></a>
<a name="IDX148"></a>
<a name="IDX149"></a>
<a name="IDX150"></a>
<p>There are two advantages to writing specifications with abstract values
instead of directly using Java variables and data structures.
The first is that by using abstract values,
the specification does not have to be
changed when the particular data structure used in the program is changed.
This permits different implementations of the same specification
to use different data structures.
Therefore the specification forms a contract between the rest
of the program in the implementation, which ensures that the rest of the
program is also independent of the particular data structures used
[Liskov-Guttag86] [Meyer97] [Meyer92a] [Parnas72].
Second, it allows the specification to be written even when
there are no implementation data structures, as is the case for <code>IntHeap</code>.
</p>
<a name="IDX151"></a>
<a name="IDX152"></a>
<a name="IDX153"></a>
<a name="IDX154"></a>
<a name="IDX155"></a>
<a name="IDX156"></a>
<a name="IDX157"></a>
<a name="IDX158"></a>
<a name="IDX159"></a>
<a name="IDX160"></a>
<a name="IDX161"></a>
<a name="IDX162"></a>
<a name="IDX163"></a>
<a name="IDX164"></a>
<a name="IDX165"></a>
<a name="IDX166"></a>
<a name="IDX167"></a>
<p>This idea of model-oriented specification has been followed in VDM
[Jones90], VDM-SL [Fitzgerald-Larsen98] [ISO96], Z [Hayes93] [Spivey92],
and the Larch family [Guttag-Horning93].
In the Larch approach,
the essential elaboration of Hoare's original idea is that
the abstract values also come with a set of operations.
The operations on abstract values
are used to precisely describe the set of abstract values
and to make it possible to abbreviate interface specifications
(pre- and postconditions for methods).
In Z one builds abstract values using tuples, sets, relations, functions,
sequences, and bags; these all come with pre-defined operations that
can be used in assertions.
In VDM one has a similar collection of mathematical tools to describe
abstract values, and another set of pre-defined operations.
In the Larch approach, there are some pre-defined kinds of abstract values
(found in Guttag and Horning's LSL Handbook, Appendix A of [Guttag-Horning93]),
but these are expected to be extended as needed.
(The advantage of being able to extend the mathematical vocabulary is
similar to one advantage of object-oriented programming:
one can use a vocabulary that is close to the way one thinks about a
problem.)
</p>
<a name="IDX168"></a>
<a name="IDX169"></a>
<a name="IDX170"></a>
<a name="IDX171"></a>
<p>However, there is a problem with using mathematical notations for
describing abstract values and their operations.  The problem is that
such mathematical notations are an extra burden on a programmer who is
learning to use a specification language.
The solution to this problem
is the essential insight that JML takes from the Eiffel
language [Meyer92a] [Meyer92b] [Meyer97].
Eiffel is a programming language with built-in specification
constructs.  It features pre- and postconditions, although it has no
direct support for frame axioms.
Programmers like Eiffel because they can easily read the assertions,
which are written in Eiffel's own expression syntax.  However, Eiffel
does not provide support for specification-only variables, and it does
not provide much explicit support for describing abstract values.
Because of this, it is difficult to write specifications that are as
mathematically complete in Eiffel as one can write in a language like
VDM or Larch/C++.
</p>
<p>JML attempts to combine the good features of these approaches.  From
Eiffel we have taken the idea that assertions can be written in a
language that is based on Java expressions.
<a name="IDX172"></a>
We also adopt the &ldquo;<code>old</code>&rdquo; notation from Eiffel, which appears
in JML as <code>\old</code>, instead of the Larch-style annotation of names
with state functions.  To make it easy to write more complete
specifications, however, we use various semantic ideas from
model-based specification languages.  In particular we use a variant
of abstract value specifications, where one describes the abstract
value of an object implicitly using several model fields.  These
specification-only fields allow one to implicitly partition the
abstract value of an object into smaller chunks, which helps in
stating frame axioms.  More importantly, we hide the mathematical
notation behind a facade of Java classes.  This makes it so the
operations on abstract values appear in familiar (although perhaps
verbose) Java notation, and also insulates JML from the details of the
particular mathematical logic used to do reasoning.
