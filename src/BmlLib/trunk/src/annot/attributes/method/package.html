BMLLib library. Package annot.attributes.method.
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<p>
The package represents the BML attributes that are located in
the method attribute areas. It provides procedures to
load and save them to class files.
</p>

<p>
All the BML attributes of a method are held in a single container class
{@link annot.bcclass.BCAttributeMap}.
</p>

<p>
We have two kinds of method attributes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Table-like attributes: asserts, loop specifications. These
  	  attributes are represented by subclasses of
  	  the abstract class {@link BCAttributeTable}</li>
  <li>Attributes for single clauses: method specification.
      These attributes are represented by subclasses of
      the abstract class {@link MethodAttribute}</li>
</ol>

<p>
The table-like attributes are currently:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>{@link AssertTable} - which gathers information on all
      the asserts in the body of a method</li>
  <li>{@link LoopSpecificationTable} - which gathers information on all
      loop specifications</li>
</ol>

<p>
The table-like attributes contain annotations associated with the
instructions of the method. These annotations are represented by
subclasses of {@link InCodeAnnotation}. The subclasses of the
{@link InCodeAnnotation} are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>{@link SingleAssert} - which represents assert clauses</li>
  <li>{@link SingleLoopSpecification} - which represents loop
      specification sets that contain: invariant and variant</li> 
</ol>

<p>
The attributes for single clauses are currently:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>{@link MethodSpecification} - which gathers information on the
       whole method header specification in a simplified view this
       is a sequence of (generalised) requires-ensures pairs
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
A single method header with BML specifications is represented by
{@link MethodSpecificationAttribute}. This attribute contains
a sequence of specification cases (roughly speaking requires-ensures
pairs) represented by objects of {@link SpecificationCase}.
</p>

<p>
Each {@link SpecificationCase} object consists of (possibly null):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>expression for precondition</li>
  <li>expression for postcondition</li>
  <li>modifies expression</li>
  <li>a (possibly empty) sequence of exceptional conditions</li>
</ol>

<p>
This package contains also an auxiliary class {@link SingleList} which
is used to gather together all the asserts associated with a single
instruction in the bytecode.
