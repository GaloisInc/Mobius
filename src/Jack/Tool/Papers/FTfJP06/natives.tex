\title{Adding native specifications to JML}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In the specification language JML we can see pure methods as a way to 
express user-defined predicates that will simplify the annotations. 
We take this idea a step further in allowing 
to only declare these predicates in JML without giving an explicit definition.
The explicit definition is done directly in the language
to which the Java program and the specifications are 
translated. To this end we introduce a new keyword to JML, the keyword 
\code{native}. 
To facilitate these definitions we have enabled the user to define 
also \code{native} types in the same way.
In this paper we will describe these new constructs as well as their 
implementation in Jack, 
 and their application to JML's libraries and model fields.
