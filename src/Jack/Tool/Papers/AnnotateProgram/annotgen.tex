\section{Annotation Generation}\label{SecAnnotGen}

Given a security property encoded as a PA, the annotation generation
procedure generates JML-annotations that capture this property,
\emph{i.e.}, if the program respects the property encoded by the
monitor, then it does not violate the generated annotations. As
explained above, the procedure is defined in several steps:
\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape i\upshape)]
\item the monitor is completed; %(as described in Section~\ref{SecPA});
\item the annotations are generated at the method specification level,
as special set-annotations; and
\item the method specification-level set-annotations are inlined in
the method body.
\end{inparaenum}
Notice that the special \CaseJML statement could be translated into
standard JML annotations as well.

For each step we prove that the new program simulates the old program,
\emph{i.e.}, we show for every translation step
\(\alpha\) there exists a relation \(R\) such that:
\[{\small
\begin{array}{l}
\forall b, \sigma_1, \sigma_2, \tau_1, v_1.
\etp{P}{b,\sigma_1}{v_1, \sigma_2} \wedge
R(\sigma_1, \tau_1) \Rightarrow \\
\qquad
\exists \tau_2, v_2.
\etp{\alpha(P)}{b, \tau_1}{v_2, \tau_2} \wedge
R(\sigma_2, \tau_2)
\end{array}}
\]
Additionally, we show that the initial program states are related by
\(R\), and from this we can conclude that for any reachable state of
the monitored program, there exists a related state, reachable in the
translated program. As a side-remark, for translation steps~(\emph{i})
and~(\emph{iii}), we can even prove that relation \(R\) is a
bisimulation, while for step~(\emph{ii}) we can only prove existence
of a simulation (since non-terminating monitored programs~--~for which
no derivation exists in the natural semantics~--~might terminate after
annotation generation, because of an annotation violation).

A natural way to prove the simulation is by induction over the
derivation length.  However, induction can only be applied when the
body is unchanged. Since the translation introduces new (ghost)
variables to encode the PA, this is not always the case. For these
cases, separate preservation lemmas have to be proven.  Further, to be
able to complete the proof, we need to ensure that in both bodies the
same branches of conditional expressions and statements are taken, and
that the same values get assigned to the store. Therefore, we prove a
stronger result, adding that also the values %resulting values
\(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the same (for step~(\emph{ii}): provided the
monitor did not reach the \halted state).


\paragraph{Completion of the automaton}
The first translation step does not change the program itself, it only
completes the PA. Suppose that \(P\) is a monitored program, where the
monitor \(\pa(P)\) is deterministic and wellformed. Then the
translation to a monitored program with a total PA, \(\alpha_1(P)\),
is defined as:
%% This is complete_MP in MonitoredProgramCompletessRelation
\[{\small
\alpha_1(P) = \opri \pa := \complete(P.\pa), \program := P.\program
\clri
}
\]

The relation that is preserved between executions of \(P\) and
%% This is monitor_related_states
\(\alpha_1(P)\) is the following (where \(\sigma\) is a state of
\(P\) and \(\tau\) is a state of \(\alpha_1(P)\)):
\[{\small
R(\sigma, \tau) =\\
 \begin{array}[t]{l}
  (\pif {\sigma.\stuck}{\tau.\pastate.\cp = \halted\\\ }
        {\sigma.\pastate.\cp = \tau.\pastate.\cp}) \:\wedge
  \neg \tau.\stuck \:\wedge\\
  (\sigma.\pastate.\stA = \tau.\pastate.\stA) \:\wedge\\
  (\sigma.\pstate = \tau.\pstate) \:\wedge\: (\sigma.\gvs = \tau.\gvs)
\end{array}}
\]

To prove that this relation is preserved for any body \(b\), we
use equivalence (\ref{PAcompletionProp}) on
Page~\pageref{PAcompletionProp} and we observe further that
\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape i\upshape)]
\item if \stuck has been set, it remains set,
\item for a total PA, if  \halted is reached, it is never left, and
\item for a total PA, \stuck is never set.
\end{inparaenum} Formally, where \(P\) is a monitored program, and
\(Q\) is a monitored program with total PA:
\[{\small
\begin{array}[t]{rl}
\sigma_1.\stuck \wedge \etp{P}{b,\sigma_1}{v,\sigma_2} \Rightarrow &
\sigma_2.\stuck \\
\sigma_1.\pastate.\cp = \halted \wedge
\etp{Q}{b,\sigma_1}{v,\sigma_2} \Rightarrow &
\sigma_2.\pastate.\cp = \halted \\
\neg \sigma_1.\stuck \wedge \etp{Q}{b,\sigma_1}{v,\sigma_2} \Rightarrow &
\neg \sigma_2.\stuck
\end{array}}
\]

To illustrate how the annotation generation algorithm
works on the LimitSMS automaton in Figure~\ref{FigExample}, assume
we have declared a class \texttt{Messaging}, containing the
methods used by the automaton, plus a method \texttt{receiveSMS}.
Applying translation \(\alpha_1\) means that this class, instead of
being monitored by the partial PA in Figure~\ref{FigExample}, is
monitored by the total PA in Figure~\ref{FigCompletePA}.

\caption{Formal definition of translation PA into annotations}
\label{FigPAtoAnnot}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{FigPAtoAnnot} contains the formal definition of the
second translation step: from PA to method-level set-annotations.
Given a monitored program \(P\) where \(\pa(P)\) is total,
the annotation generation algorithm \(\alpha_2\) applies
\(\alpha_{2, \mathcal{C}}\) to all classes.
This function checks whether the class is the one being
monitored. If so, appropriate ghost variables are added to the class
using the function \newgvs (see the PVS formalisation for its formal
definition). Basically
\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape i\upshape)]
\item for each automaton control point \(q\), a (final) ghost
variable declaration \texttt{q} is generated, initialised to a unique value;
% (\emph{i.e.}, we assume we have a function \unique that maps each
% control point to a unique integer);
\item a ghost variable \texttt{cp} is declared, initialised to the
value of the ghost variable representing the initial control point; and
\item for each automaton variable declaration, a ghost variable is
declared with corresponding name, type and initialisation.
\end{inparaenum}
Further, \(\alpha_{2, \mathcal{C}}\) adds the condition that the
current control point should not be \halted to the class
invariant\footnote{For readability, we do not explicitly write the
translation from PA control points to ghost variables.}, and it
annotates all methods in the class using \(\alpha_{2,
\mathcal{M}}\). For each method, \preset, \postset
and \excset are extended with updates to the ghost variables encoding
the automaton. In addition, at the end of \preset, an \Assert
statement is added to verify whether the transition reached the
\halted state: in that case program execution should terminate
immediately.  Without this \Assert, the property violation would only
be detected after the body is executed. To encode the updates to the
ghost variables, \(\alpha_{2, \mathcal{E}}\) computes the set of
relevant transitions (\emph{i.e.}, those where the event and method
name correspond). For these transitions, a \CaseJML statement is
generated, where the different cases correspond to the current control
point being equal to a control point \texttt{q}, for any
\texttt{q} in the automaton. For each such \texttt{q}, \(\alpha_{2,
\mathcal{S}}\) selects the transitions where \(t.\scp\) is \texttt{q}
and generates a \CaseJML statement, that tests whether the guard
holds, and if so, sets the control point \texttt{cp} to
\(t.\tcp\), and executes the actions associated with this
transition.  Notice that the order in which the different cases are
generated is not important: since the PA is total and deterministic
there is always exactly one case that applies.

The formalisation does not specify how guards and actions are
translated. Instead, we assume there exists a translation into
expressions in the programming language that
\begin{inparaenum}[(\itshape i\upshape)]
\item are wellformed,
\item give the same result,
\item do not have side-effects,
\item do not throw exceptions, and
\item do not contain method calls.
\end{inparaenum}
From this we can derive that in the annotated program, the generated
statements in \preset can only throw a \JMLExc (because of the
concluding \Assert), while the generated statements in \postset
and \excset do not throw any exception.

%To illustrate the translation on our running example
As an example, consider again
the class \texttt{Messaging} and the completed
PA, encoding the \emph{limited SMS} policy, in
Figure~\ref{FigCompletePA}. Figure~\ref{FigExampleStep2} shows the
generated annotations that result from applying translation
\(\alpha_2,\mathcal{C}\) on this class and this PA. Notice that for methods
and events that are not involved in the property, an empty \CaseJML is
generated~--~this is equivalent to a
\Skip statement.

To show correctness of the translation, we show that the following
relation is preserved (where \(P\) is the monitored program,
\(\sigma\) a state of the monitored program, and \(\tau\) a state
of the annotated program):
\[{\small
\begin{array}{rcl}
%% This is related_states
R(\sigma, \tau) & = & \neg \sigma.\stuck \:\wedge\\
& & \begin{array}[t]{l}
\mathsf{if\ }\sigma.\pastate.\cp = \halted
\mathsf{\ then\ }\tau.\pstate.\ex = \JMLExc
\mathsf{\ else\ }S(\sigma, \tau)
\end{array}\\
%% This is mp_modeled
S(\sigma, \tau) & = &
\begin{array}[t]{l}
(\unique(\sigma.\pastate.\cp) = \tau.\gvs(\texttt{cp})) \:\wedge\\
\forall q \in P.\pa.\cps.\ (\unique(q) = \tau.\gvs(\texttt{q})) \:\wedge\\
\forall n \in \Name. (\sigma.\pastate(n) \not= \perp \Rightarrow
\sigma.\pastate(n) = \tau.\gvs(n)) \:\wedge\\
\sigma.\pstate = \tau.\pstate \:\wedge\\
\forall n \in \Name. (\sigma.\gvs(n) \not= \perp \Rightarrow
\sigma.\gvs(n) = \tau.\gvs(n))
\end{array}
\end{array}}
\]
This relation specifies that if the monitor has reached
control point  \halted, the annotated program must have thrown a
\JMLExc. Otherwise, the state of the annotated program corresponds to
the state of the original program, extended with the modeling of the
monitor's state. This means that the program states (fields,
local variables and exceptions) have to coincide, just as the values
of the ghost variables that are declared in the original program
\(P\). Further, the current control point is represented by the value
stored in ghost variable \texttt{cp}, and all PA control points and
variables correspond to ghost variables. Notice that if an annotation
already present in \(P\) causes a \JMLExc, both the monitored and the
annotated program will throw it.  Therefore, we cannot prove that the
annotated program throws a \JMLExc \emph{if and only if} \halted is
reached.

To prove that this relation is a preserved, it is
strengthened with the following property: if the control point is not
\halted, then the derivations also produce the same value. The crucial
part in the proof is of course what happens upon method call and
termination. For example, when a method is called, first the invariant
and the precondition are evaluated. Assuming that \halted is not yet
reached, the new conjunct of the invariant evaluates to true, and
induction allows to derive that after evaluation of the precondition,
the states are related by \(R\). Next, the original \preset
annotations are evaluated, and again the induction hypothesis allows
to conclude that the resulting states are related. Next, the monitored
program makes a PA transition, and the annotated program executes the
newly generated set annotations, followed by an \Assert to check
whether
\halted has been reached. Here we cannot use the induction hypothesis,
but instead we show manually that relation \(R\) is preserved.

Notice that in \postset or \excset we do not have an \Assert
statement. Since the invariant is evaluated immediately after the
set-annotations, the reaching of \halted will be detected
immediately. For this part of the proof it is crucial that
the newly added invariant is evaluated first.

Finally,  to complete the proof, we have to make a
restriction on the behaviour of \TryCatch. We follow the Java Language
Specification in describing its behaviour~\cite{GoslingJSB05}. This
means in particular that if the \emph{finally} block in the statement
terminates abnormally (because of an exception, or any other reason
for abrupt completion), it overrides a possible exception thrown in
the \emph{try} or \emph{catch} block. Thus, for example, if \halted
is reached in the \emph{try} block, and hence a \JMLExc is thrown, this
exception might be overwritten by an exception thrown in the
\emph{finally} block (see also~\cite{Huisman08} for a discussion of
this problem), which would mean that the violation of the security
policy is not signalled to the user, and instead execution
continues. To avoid this, we require that for all \TryCatch statements
in the program, if the \emph{try} or
\emph{catch} block throws a \JMLExc, the whole statement
also terminates exceptionally because of a \JMLExc.



\paragraph{Inlining the Annotations}
Once the set-annotations at method specification level are generated,
the next step is to inline them into the method bodies.  To ensure
that the appropriate set-statements are always executed at the end of
the method body, the body is wrapped in a
\TryCatch statement. The translation \(\alpha_3\) applies
\(\alpha_{3, \mathcal{C}}\) to all classes, which in turn applies
\(\alpha_{3, \mathcal{M}}\) to all methods in the class. This function
generates one new local variable\footnote{In fact, this should be a
local \emph{ghost} variable, but these are not yet supported by our
formalisation, therefore we formalise it as a standard local
variable.} \resl. The body of the method is changed as follows: all
code is wrapped in two \TryCatch statements, to catch \Throwable and
\NullPointer exceptions\footnote{For simplicity, we do not model the
exception hierarchy and thus \TryCatch can only catch a single
exception, but in practice only one \emph{try-catch-finally} instruction
would be necessary.}. In the \emph{try} block, first \preset is
executed, followed by the body of the method. Then the result
expression from the original body is evaluated, and assigned to
\resl. Next, \postset is executed. Notice that the latter
is only executed if the body actually terminates normally, otherwise
the exception will simply be propagated. Finally, in the \emph{catch}
clauses, \excset is executed. The new result expression of the method
is the look up of the variable \resl. To conclude, \preset,
\postset and  \excset in the method specification are set to
\Skip. Figure~\ref{FigInline} gives the formal definition of
\(\alpha_{3, \mathcal{M}}\) (where \(P\) is a program, and \(m\) a method).

\begin{figure}[t]
\[
\alpha_{3, \mathcal{M}}(P, m) = m \opri
\begin{array}[t]{l}
\preset := \Skip, \postset := \Skip, \excset := \Skip,\\
\lvars := \{\resl\} \cup m.\lvars,
\res := \lookup(\resl), \\

\quad \begin{array}[t]{l}
  \TryCatch( \begin{array}[t]{l} m.\preset; m.\body; \\ \Assign(\resl,
  m.\res); m.\postset\\ \end{array}\\ \Throwable, m.\excset, \Skip),
\end{array}\\
\NullPointer, m.\excset, \Skip) \clri
\end{array}
\end{array}
\]\vspace*{-2em}
\caption{Formal definition of annotation inlining for methods}\label{FigInline}
\end{figure}

To prove correctness of this translation, we use the following
relation: all fields and ghost variables coincide, exceptions
coincide, and all local variables that are declared in the original
program coincide. In the correctness proof, we use that the \postset
and \excset annotations do not throw any exceptions, and \preset may only
throw a \JMLExc. Moreover, we use that the set-annotations do not
contain method calls, from which we can conclude that they do not
modify any variables that are not explicitly mentioned in them. In
particular, this allows to conclude that the new local variable is
not changed by the set annotations.
