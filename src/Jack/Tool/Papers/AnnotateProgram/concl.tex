\section{Conclusions \& Future Work }\label{SecConcl}

 In earlier work,
we have presented the propagation
algorithm~\cite{PavlovaBBHL04}, and proven correctness for a
limited case (only static properties that do not depend on concrete
program instances are considered, and branching conditions are not
taken into account~--~the two possible branches are simply both
propagated). It is future work to extend this to a complete
correctness proof, and to improve the propagation algorithm to take
branching conditions into account (as much as possible). We will then
also exploit the existing PVS formalisation, to prove the formal
correctness of the propagation with a theorem prover.
