\begin{abstract}
Security automata are a convenient way to describe security
policies. Their typical use is to monitor the execution of an
application, and to interrupt this as soon as the security policy is
violated. However, run-time adherence checking is not always
convenient. Instead, we aim at developing a technique to verify
adherence to a security policy statically.  To do this, we consider
the security automata as specification, and we generate JML
annotations that inline the monitor~--~as a specification~--~into the
application.

This paper describes the translation from security automata to program
annotations and proves preservation of program behaviour. This boils
down to a proof that monitoring will not reveal a security violation
iff the generated annotations are respected by the program.

The correctness proofs are formalised using the PVS theorem prover.
This reveals several subtleties to be considered in the definition of the
translation algorithm and in the program requirements.
