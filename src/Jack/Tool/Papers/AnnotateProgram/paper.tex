\begin{abstract}
Security automata are a convenient way to describe security
policies. Their typical use is to monitor the execution of an
application, and to interrupt this as soon as the security policy is
violated. However, run-time adherence checking is not always
convenient. Instead, we aim at developing a technique to verify
adherence to a security policy statically.  To do this, we consider
the security automata as specification, and we generate JML
annotations that inline the monitor~--~as a specification~--~into the
application.

% and verify adherence to it statically. We achieve this by generation
% of JML annotations that inline the monitor into the application.
%  We want to achieve this by
% generation of JML annotations 

% This paper describes the translation from security automata to program
% annotations, and proves that every translation step preserves the
% program behaviour.
% For this, we have developed a generic program semantics that is instantiated
% for monitoring and run-time annotation checking.
% Preservation of program behaviour boils down to a proof
% that monitoring will not find a security violation iff run-time
% annotation checking will not find any annotation violation (provided
% that earlier existing annotations are not violated either).

This paper describes the translation from security automata to program
annotations and proves preservation of program behaviour. This boils
down to a proof that monitoring will not reveal a security violation
iff the generated annotations are respected.

%
% AT: This is future work.
% Once the program annotations are generated, an annotation propagation algorithm
% can be used to generate appropriate pre- and postconditions that
% are sufficient to guarantee adherence to the annotations, and that can
% be verified statically.
%
% Both program semantics, translation and correctness proofs are
% formalised using the PVS theorem prover. The correctness proofs
% revealed several subtleties that have to be considered in the
% definition of the algorithm and the program behaviour.
The correctness proofs are formalised using the PVS theorem prover.
This reveals several subtleties to be considered in the definition of the
translation algorithm and in the program requirements.
