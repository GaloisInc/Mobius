This paper proposes a method, implemented in the \textsf{JAG}
tool to verify a liveness operator in Java using JML annotations. 
The verification is divided
into two subtasks: (1)~generation of appropriate JML annotations that
allow to verify that the class under consideration respects the
liveness property, and (2)~showing that the environment preserves the
liveness properties by proving a liveness preserving simulation. 
For the generation of
appropriate JML annotations, we require a
\emph{variant} and an \emph{invariant} (conform variants and invariants
to show termination of loops). We then show that under certain
assumptions on the environment, we can prove the satisfaction of the
liveness properties. The second subtask then boils down to showing that
the given environment in fact respects these assumptions. The method is
illustrated by an example.
