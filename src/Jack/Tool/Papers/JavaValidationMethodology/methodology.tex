\chapter{Tools and Methodologies}
This chapter describes some tools that have been developed during the Inspired project, that can be handled to validate Java applications and methodologies that can be applied depending on different validation purposes.
All those tools are part a Java application validation workshop called JACK.

The first section is a general presentation of the JACK tool, section 2 introduces a JACK extension allowing to verify with some automation some security properties, section 3 presents an associated tool allowing to describe security properties with automata, section 4 is about the proof facilities in JACK, section 5 describes Jack features at bytecode level and section 6 concludes with some perspectives in Java application validation tool development.
