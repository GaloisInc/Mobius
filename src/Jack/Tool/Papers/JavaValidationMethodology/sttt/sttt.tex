\section{The JML tool suite}
\label{tools}

Since JML specifications are meant to be read and written by ordinary
Java programmers, it is important to support the conventional ways
that these programmers create and use documentation.  Consequently,
the {\tt jmldoc} tool
produces browsable HTML pages containing both the
API and the specifications for Java code, in the style of pages
generated by Javadoc~\cite{Friendly95}.

%=====================================================================
The JML compiler (\texttt{jmlc}), developed at Iowa State University,
is an extension to a Java compiler and compiles Java programs
annotated with JML specifications into Java
bytecode~\cite{Cheon03,Cheon-Leavens02b}.  The compiled bytecode includes
runtime assertion checking instructions that check JML specifications
such as preconditions, normal and exceptional postconditions,
invariants, and history constraints.  The execution of such assertion
checks is transparent in that, unless an assertion is violated, and
except for performance measures (time and space), the behavior of the
original program is unchanged.  The transparency of runtime assertion
checking is guaranteed, as JML assertions are not allowed to have any
side-effects~\cite{Leavens-etal03a}.
