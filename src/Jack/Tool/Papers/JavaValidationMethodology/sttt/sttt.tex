\section{Tools for JML}
\label{tools}

For a specification language, just as for a programming language, a
range of tools is necessary to address the various needs of the
specification language's users such as reading, writing, and checking
JML annotations.
This section describes the various tools that are currently
available for JML.

\subsection{Documentation Generation}
\label{jmldoc}

Since JML specifications are meant to be read and written by ordinary
Java programmers, it is important to support the conventional ways
that these programmers create and use documentation.  Consequently,
the {\tt jmldoc} tool (authored by David Cok)
produces browsable HTML pages containing both the
API and the specifications for Java code, in the style of pages
generated by Javadoc~\cite{Friendly95}.
The {\tt jmldoc} tool combines and displays in one place all of the
specifications that pertain to a given class, interface, method, or
field; it combines annotations across a series of source files that
constitute successive refinements of a given class or interface, as
well as the relevant specifications of overridden methods.

\subsection{Runtime Assertion Checking}
\label{jmlc}

The JML compiler (\texttt{jmlc}), developed at Iowa State University,
is an extension to a Java compiler and compiles Java programs
annotated with JML specifications into Java
bytecode~\cite{Cheon03,Cheon-Leavens02b}.  The compiled bytecode includes
runtime assertion checking instructions that check JML specifications
such as preconditions, normal and exceptional postconditions,
invariants, and history constraints.  The execution of such assertion
checks is transparent in that, unless an assertion is violated, and
except for performance measures (time and space), the behavior of the
original program is unchanged.  The transparency of runtime assertion
checking is guaranteed, as JML assertions are not allowed to have any
side-effects~\cite{Leavens-etal03a}.
