\section{Bytecode Verifier}
The tools have also been tested on a bytecode verifier java implementation. A termination proof has been provided.
A specific implementation has been coded with on one hand the main loop which remain unchanged whatever the specifications of the virtual machine Java chosen, and other instructions and memory states which depends on selected model.
\subsection{Implementation and Modelisation}
The main loop is in a package which contains abstract classes: 
the instructions and the states are implemented in a more generic way.
The package containing the implementation is composed from the instructions for the standard Java types and of the states of memory typing. 
\subsubsection {Memory states}
The memory states are represented by the State class, which is an abstract class.  It does not contain any precise definition of the memory: 
one has no information on the stack or on the local variables table. 
The implementation is relatively simple: 
it is a class which contains a type stack and a table of the types of the local variables. 
Functions allowing to read simply these structures and to generate verification error in the cases of misuse are defined.   
\subsubsection{Instructions}
The instructions are also represented by an abstract class: 
the class Instruction.  
Since in the Kildall algorithm each instruction is associated to a memory state,  the Instruction class has a field of the State type. 
An instruction can also have one or more successors. 
This relation is represented by a field which is the list of the successors of the instruction.  
One of the other aspects is the fact that on associate to each instruction a boolean field to determine if it has been modified or not.

Several properties of the bytecode verifier are formalised in this class.
First of all one verifies that the successors of the instruction are well included in the others instructions of the program. 
If these successors pointed towards external instructions, an verification error would be returned. 

The others important properties concern the pure function {\tt
buildNewState}.  This function builds the typing state of the
execution of an instruction on the current state.  This construction
can fail if the instruction tries for example to pop an element when
the stack is empty.  If it succeeds, a new non null state is built.


Around ten instructions have been implemented: {\tt load} and {\tt
blind} for the access to local variables, {\tt push} and {\tt pop} to
obtain or put element on the stack, {\tt op1} and {\tt op2} which is
two operators who consume both the two top element of the stack and
which replaces them by a result of a certain type, {\tt ifle} and {\tt
jump} instructions of jump towards another instruction successor, {\tt
nop} the instruction which does not do anything and finally {\tt stop}
which is an instruction which does not have a successor.  These
instructions have an associated type in the OperandType class, who can
be None, Type1 or Type2.  Those are the minimal instructions to have a
Java-like program.

\subsubsection {The main loop}
The main loop is implemented in the Verifier class.  It is not an
abstract class because it uses the properties of the State and
Instruction abstract classes to verify an instruction set on
particular states.  This class provides two functions, the function
{\tt verify} in which the loop is written and the function {\tt check}
which verify an instruction.

%The m \ 'ethode check ensures that all \ 'states of the successors of an instruction donn \ 'ee,    are larger or \ 'equal that the \ 'states before the ex \ 'ecution of the m \ 'ethode. This   propri \ 'and \ 'E seems simple \ `has to express but it implies several Pr \ 'erequis.  First of all it should be guaranteed that the successors of the instructions point all worms of   valid instructions. Then that all the instructions are diff \ 'erentes of no one and that theirs  \ 'states are too diff \ 'erents of no one them.    The Pr \ calculation weaker 'econdition of Jack forces us \ `has to add these propri \ 'and \ 'be    Li \ 'ees \ `with the S \ 'emantic of the language Java.  .   %Pour to facilitate the evidence I have \ 'and \ 'E oblig \ 'E  %de to add a certain number of assertions.    

The {\ tt verify} method is the main loop of the bytecode verifier.
It contains two nested loops. The internal one is a {\tt for} loop
which iterates on the instructions and verify all the quoted
instructions (as described in the Kildall algorithm). The termination
of the internal loop is easy to prove.  The {\tt for} loop executes as
many time as there are numbers in the table.  The external {\tt while}
loop stops the algorithm when no more instruction typing state is
modified.  This termination is not obvious to prove, especially with
JML, since it only allow to prove loop termination by giving an
integer variant.

Since the states have to be used to show the algorithm termination,
one has to make correspond each state with an integer. Thus at each
loop iteration, the integer associated with the state either increase
or preserve the same value; and it exists a maximum value.

\subsection{Proofs}
The first proofs are relatively easy.  The State class is proved
almost automatically; these proofs are not due to the code of the
methods but some standard verification Jack adds to each methods,
mostly to verify that all the public invariants are not broken after
the execution of each method.  Since the methods in the State class
are quite simple (and do not break the invariants), the automation is
good for these kind of proof obligations.  The only special case is
for the constructor where it is necessary to break a disjunction ({\tt
instance S $\vee$ S = null}) to prove the invariants.


The Instruction class has also been relatively easy to prove.  A
significant number of proof was done automatically (approximately 90
\%) and as for the State class this was mainly the verifications of
invariants; then majority of proof could be trivially resolved as most
of the methods are observer or accessors to private fields.  Two
methods verify some properties over the instructions, namely {\tt
checkDomain} which checks if the successors of the instruction are
contained in the program and {\tt isSuccessor} which test if the
instruction passed as a parameter is in the list of the successors of
the current instruction.  Thes two methods contains loops, so the
proof obligations generated are quite differents. We have to use some
arithmetic to prove their termination, which is not automated since it
does not appear often.  Finally the Verifier class was harder to
prove. One of the main reason is that the main method contains 2
loops; the inner one, easy to verify (a bit more difficult than the
ones contained in the Instruction class) because it simply consult
each intruction of the instruction array representing the program, but
with much more properties expressed on it. The proof obligations
generated for the main loop containing the inner loop are harder to
prove because the loop terminates only if it reaches a fixpoint, so it
cannot be expressed by simple arithmetic like the previous ones.  The
lemmas of this class were containing too many hypotheses to be
automatically proved.  In fact for each class some properties are
brought from the previous ones, this adds lots of hypothesis but it
adds too to the complexity of the proofs.  That's why there was some
kind of exponentional growth in the size of the proof obligations for
each class when they were defined.  Around 500 proof obligations had
to be solved manually.  Some of them were obvious and were resolved
with quite the same script, but the script cannot be automated.  Some
of them were complex: the proof script became little large (an average
of 30 steps).  As one should expect the lemmas concerning the loop
invariant of the verify method and its initialization were the most
difficult to prove.

\section{JavaCard applet security properties}
To show the usefulness of the security property propagation, we applied it to
several realistic examples of smart card applications. When doing
this, we actually found violations against the security policies
documented for some of these applications.

\subsection{Automatic Verification of Security Properties}\label{SecVerif}
As explained above, we are interested in the verification of
high-level security properties that are not directly related to a
single method or class, but that guarantee the overall
well-functioning of an application. Writing appropriate JML
annotations for such properties is tedious and error-prone, as they
have to be spread all over the application. Therefore, we propose a
way to construct such annotations automatically. First we synthesize
core-annotations for methods directly involved in the property.  For
example, when specifying that no nested transactions are allowed, we
annotate the methods \texttt{beginTransaction},
\texttt{commitTransaction} and
\texttt{abortTransaction}. Subsequently, we propagate the necessary 
annotations to all methods (directly or indirectly) invoking these
core-methods.  The generated annotations are sufficient to respect the
security properties, \emph{i.e.}~if the applet does not violate the
annotations, it respects the corresponding high-level security
property.

Whether the applet respects its annotations can be established with
JACK~\cite{BRL-JACK}. Since for most security properties the
annotations are relatively simple---but there are many---it is
important that these verifications are done automatically, without any
user interaction. The results in Section~\ref{SecResults} show that
for the generated annotations all correct proof obligations can indeed
be automatically discharged.
