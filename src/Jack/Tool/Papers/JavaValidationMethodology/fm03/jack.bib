                 specification of smart card programs, using ESC/Java.
                 It discusses an electronic purse application, provided
                 by Gemplus, that we have annotated with functional
                 specifications (i.e., pre- and post-conditions,
                 modifies clauses and class invariants) that are as
                 detailed as possible. The specification is based on the
                 informal documentation of the application. Using
                 ESC/Java, the implementation has been checked with
                 respect to the specification. This revealed several
                 errors or possibilities for improvement in the source
                 code (such as removing unnecessary tests). Our paper
                 shows that a relatively lightweight use of formal
                 specification techniques can already have a serious
                 impact on the quality of a program and its
                 documentation. Furthermore, we also present some ideas
                 on how ESC/Java could be further improved, both with
                 respect to specification and verification.",

                 components such as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), API,
                 verifier, and a loader. It is of prime importance to
                 ensure that these components are implemented in
                 accordance with their specifications. Formal methods
                 can be used to bring the mathematical proof that their
                 implementation corresponds to their specification. In
                 this paper, we introduce the formal development of a
                 complete byte code verifier for Java Card and its
                 on-card integration. In particular, we aim to focus on
                 the model and the proof of the complete type verifier
                 for the Java Card language. The global architecture of
                 the verification process implemented in real industrial
                 case study is described and the detailed specification
                 of the type verifier is discusses as well as its proof.
                 Moreover, this paper presents a comparison between
                 formal and traditional development, summing up the pros
                 and cons of using formal methods in industry.",
