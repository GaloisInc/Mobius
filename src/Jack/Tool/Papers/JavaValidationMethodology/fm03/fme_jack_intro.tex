  This section presents the Java Applet Correctness Kit
 (or \JACK).  This tool, already briefly described in
 \cite{BR-gdc2002,BRL-JACK}, is a formal tool that allows one to prove properties on
 Java programs using the Java Modeling Language \cite{Leavens-Baker-Ruby03} (JML).
 It generates proof obligations
 allowing to prove that the Java code conforms to its JML
 specification.  The lemmas are translated into an internal formula language called JPOL. Then JPOL verification conditions are translated into differents prover language, namely Coq, PVS, Simplify and the B language \cite{bbook},
 allowing to use the automatic provers Simplify and the provers developed within the B method and interactive provers like the Coq proof assistant, PVS or Click'n'Prove .

 But the tool is not yet another lemma generator for Java, since it also provides a lemma
 viewer integrated in the eclipse
 IDE\footnote{\texttt{http://www.eclipse.org}}.  This allows to
 hide the formalisms used behind a graphical interface.  Lemmas are
 presented to users in a way they can understand them easier, by using the Java syntax and highlighting code portions to help
 the understanding. Using \JACK, one does not have to learn a formal language to be convience on
code correctness.

 The remainder of the section is organized as follow.  Subsection \ref{JavaAppletCorrectnessKit} presents the
 architecture and the main principles of the tool we have
 developed.
Subsection~\ref{JPOL} presents the Java/Jack Proof Obligation Language (JPOL).
Subection~\ref{Industrialisation} describes more precisely
 the innovative parts of the tool and explains why we consider it as
 accessible to any developers and Subsection \ref{Conclusion} concludes.
