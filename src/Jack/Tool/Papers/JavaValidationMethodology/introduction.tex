\chapter{Introduction}
Providing high quality on applet development is becoming a crucial issue, 
especially when those applets are aimed to be loaded and executed in secure device like smart cards.  
Actually, the card remains a specific domain where post issuance corrections are very expensive due to the deployment process and the mass production.
Currently, the quality is ensured by costly test campaigns, 
whenever tests are technically possible. 
We consider that using formal techniques is a solution that allows to increase the quality, but also to reduce validation costs.

Nevertheless, proving program correctness, and more generally using
formal methods, is traditionally an activity reserved for experts.  
This restriction is usually caused by the mathematical nature of the concepts involved.
This explains why formal techniques are difficult to introduce in industrial processes, even if they are now widely used in research and teaching activities.
However, we believe that this restriction can be reduced by providing notations and tools hiding the mathematical formalisms.
Therefore, formal tools should be developed to fit into classical developers environment.
We strongly believe that efforts should be done to allow users to benefit from formal techniques without having to learn new formalisms and to become experts.

All the tools and results presented in this document were developed with this goal in mind, notably the choose of JML as assertion language and the development of JACK and its associated feature.
Using those techniques, Java developers should be able to validate their code, or at least to get a good assurance on its correctness.

This document is organized as follows, the next chapter introduce the assertion language JML, chapter 3 describes the JACK tool with its extension feature, chapter 4 presents some evaluations done with the tools and the last chapter concludes.
