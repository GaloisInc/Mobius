The verification framework we are building in this paper is an
adaptation of static verification techniques based on weakest
precondition calculus. It is based upon Java extended static verification
tools using guarded commands language like ESC/Java2~\cite{CokK04} and
what is planned to be done using BoogiePL for the Mobius
PVE~\cite{MobiusPVE07}.


The verification process is made of several steps:
First the program and the aspects are annotated:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the program and its aspects are annotated using Pipa,
\item the behavioural specifications are desugared
\item the specifications of the aspects are compiled into model
methods
\end{enumerate}
Then the proper compilation of aspects is done:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the program is compiled to bytecode with its specifications
\item the program is transformed into guarded commands
\item the model methods are weaved to the program
\end{enumerate}
Finally a weakest precondition calculus is made on the transformed
program, and verification conditions are generated in order to be
solved automatically or interactively.
