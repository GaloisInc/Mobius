The verification of Java programs is a difficult task, especially with
components like the Security Manager which modify the semantic of the
Virtual Machine.  One of the way to model this invasive behaviour is
to model the Security Manager as an aspect component, using AspectJ.

In this paper we describe a framework for static verification of Java
programs containing AspectJ advices specified with Pipa.  The
framework is built around a weakest precondition calculus over Java
bytecode using guarded commands, and is correct against AspectJ advice weaving semantic.
This framework is then instanciated over a case study, the Security
Manager.
