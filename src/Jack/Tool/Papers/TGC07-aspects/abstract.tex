The verification of Java programs is a difficult task, especially with
components like the Security Manager which modify the semantic of the
Virtual Machine.  To model this invasive behaviour is
can implement the Security Manager as an aspect component, using AspectJ.

In this paper we describe a framework for static verification of Java
programs containing AspectJ advices specified with Pipa and
we instanciate it over a case study, the Security Manager.  The
framework is built around a weakest precondition calculus over Java
bytecode using guarded commands. It has an advice weaving 
semantic which is correct against AspectJ advice weaving semantic.
