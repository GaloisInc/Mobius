The verification framework we are building in this paper is an adaptation of
static 
verification based on weakest precondition calculus for aspects. Here we will
consider 
the SecurityManager as an invasive aspect, so we must take into the weaving
process. 

To keep the calculus simple, we do the generation of the verification
conditions in 3 steps. 
First we abstract their specification from the aspects, which gives us a model
of the aspects. 
Then we statically weave these model aspects into the program, it is a
syntactic weaving so 
it is supposed to be lightweight, and finally we verify them
using a standard weakest precondition calculus.
