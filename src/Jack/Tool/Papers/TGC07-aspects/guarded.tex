\begin{itemize} 
\item 
an assert of the require clause, followed by
\item 
an instruction to state that all the variable assignable have new
values: it can be represented by JML keyword {\tt fresh} which is
usually used for method specifications, but here could be used to
annotate the method, and finally
\item the assume of the method's postcondition.
\end{itemize}
Nevertheless, the exceptional cases being difficult to desugar, it is
interesting to have the model method calls in JML specification.

The program code:
\bcode
...\\
//@ m();\\
//@ assert(i == 1);\\
...
\ecode
Could be desugared to:
\bcode
...\\
//@ assert (i > 0);\\
//@ fresh(i);\\
//@ assume (i == 1);\\
//@ assert(i == 1);\\
...
\ecode
