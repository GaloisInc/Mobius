After all the previous steps, we have a guarded command representation
of the weaved base program, a guarded command representation  of the 
weaved advices, and a model representing the advices.
What is left to do is to check the base program with a weakest precondition
calculus, check the weaved advices, and check the weaved advices against 
the model. The calculus that we use is the one presented in~\cite{BarnettL05}.
