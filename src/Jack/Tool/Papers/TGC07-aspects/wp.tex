In our framework aspects are considered as methods calls that are
transferred the whole control flow, and are permitted to modify local
variables in the caller methods. Therefore when aspects are weaved
there wp is just like the one of a method call.  For instance if an
advice is weaved before an instruction i, the effective execution of
the program will be of

The aspect are compiled into a list containing the.  The predicate
transformers associated with an advice is similar to the weakest
precondition clause toward an invasive method call i.e. a method call
that would be able to modify local variables as well as the other
program variables.

One of the amusing fact about this approach is that the weakest
precondition calculus is parametized by a new semantic which is given
by the aspects.

General form of the final wp rule: 
\bcode

\\
\ecode
where befores, arounds and afters are the compiled predicate
