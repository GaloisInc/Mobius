1. the check for the modifies clause does not work well. For the moment only the fields of the current
class are verified to be not modified. Should add also the fields from other classes that are used in the
current class.

2. Lilian - parenthesage pas bonne , example (challenge tests )  SideEffect pog not well  translated 
(example documented in testWellParenForSideEffect)


3. B2JClass - le champ 	Vector fields est initializee avec les FieldRef de constant pool. 
Je crois que le field doit etre initialise avec les fied  de la class plus tot. 
Voir quand il est appelle dans  B2JProofs.toExpression -> REsolved 

4. 23.0.05 example Compressor.output the specification
of do... while cannot be compiled, because the LineNumberTable gives 
an index of the loop start which is strange - > Resolved 

5. crypt.BuildTestData OutOfMemory - once the pogs are generated (the origin of the bug
is not very clear )

6. 05/09/2005  
bc vc gen doesnot generate a vc aboput the invariant
in an exceptional case


7. 11/10/05 
native methods in the bytecode does not have a Local Variable Table ! This is the reason
for certain NullPointerExceptions


8. 12/10/05
class invariants of the other classes are not added as assumptions when verifying
a  method, neither are proven to hold at the end of the method 


9. 13/10/05 
les hypotheses sur les variables modifiees dans les boucles doivent etre decoupees>>>>>>> 1.5

  
10 . 14/10/05 
  bug in the bytecode vc found when generating vcs for TCPIP jits.net.JKernel
  
  
11. 9/11/05
 NB: bug in the verification of modifies clauses (on bytecode and source level) -  
  by definition newly created objects  are allowed to be modified. STill the vcs on bc and src do it.
