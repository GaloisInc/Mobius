Jack is interactive prover friendly:
\blist
\item Case Explorer
\item Ability to prove only {\purple one} proof obligation
\item Can try to prove several goals automatically
\elist

\nextslide{Interacting with the prover} \small
Jack interacts with provers through some prover plugins.\\

Jack has only one way to interact with provers:\\
\rarrow It passes a {\purple list of proof obligations} (PO) to the prover.\\
If there is only one PO is most likely done from an interactive
mode.\\
\rarrow the context from which a prover is called depends on
the informations given by the {\purple prover plugin}.
