\item Interacting with the prover

\nextslide{Interacting with the user (1)}
ESC/Java has 2 interfaces:
\blist
\item A {\purple command line} interface with many switches
\item An eclipse interface which basically add some gui
  over the command line version, and permits an easier way 
  to see the {\purple warnings} of ESC/Java
\elist
POs are generated for {\purple each method}.
\nextslide{Interacting with the user (2)}
Jack is much more interactive prover friendly:
\blist
\item Case Explorer
\item Ability to prove only {\purple one} proof obligation
\item Can try to prove several goals automatically
\elist
POs are generated for each {\purple execution path}.

\nextslide{Interacting with the prover (1)}
\small
ESC/Java interacts with provers through some prover extensions.\\
ESC/Java has two kind of interaction with provers:
\blist
\item Simplify-like: \\each goal is tried with the prover and ESC/Java 
{\purple awaits}
a respond to continue verifying the program.
\item Interactive, using the {\purple new vcGen}, and recently developped interfaces
\rarrow {\purple no interaction with the prover at all}, it only generates some
files containing the lemmas to prove
\elist
\nextslide{Interacting with the prover (2)} \small
Jack interacts with provers through some prover plugins.\\

Jack has only one way to interact with provers:\\
\rarrow It passes a {\purple list of proof obligations} (PO) to the prover.\\
If there is only one PO is most likely done from an interactive
mode.\\
\rarrow the context from which a prover is called depends on
the informations given by the {\purple prover plugin}.
