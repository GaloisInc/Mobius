Provides the classes necessary to create and manage substitutions. 
<p>
Substitutions applied to goal are stored in manner to display the goal in the 
Java view in the most closest way to Java possible.
That means that rather diplaying the goal where substitution have been applied,
the goal is displayed as its original formula (coming directly from the Java
source) and subtitutions are displayed below describing the runtime behaviour
that has been applied on the goal.
<p>
This package defines an interface and its implementing classes that correspond to
each type of substitution that can be done during the WP calculus.
