The <code>instancie()</code> methods are used to desuggar Java.
They have two functions
<UL>
<li> instanciated with <code>this</code> member field that are implicitely called
with the current object.
<li> simplify full name construction to obtain
<UL>
<li> a uniq identifier to adress static fields
<li> an expression dot an identifier to adress member field. 
</UL>
</UL>
After the call of this method, the field identifiers are normalized in 
<code>a</code> if <code>a</code> is a static field or <code>b.a</code> if a is a
member field (b remains an expression).
