Supposing the execution of a method always terminates, the verification condition which expresses the fact that 
 a method \methodd  respects its specification %, the  precondition $\methodd.\pre$ and the postcondition $\methodd.\post$ 
is defined in the following way:
$$ \methodd.\pre \Rightarrow \wpi{}{\methodd}{0}$$

Moreover, if a method \methodd{} declared in a class \texttt{B} ( \methodd.\declaredIn = \texttt{B}) overrides  method \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}} from the super
 class \texttt{B} of \texttt{A}, the specification of method \methodd{} must conform with the specification of method   \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}}:
  This is expressed by the two covariant conditions over their pre and postconditions:
	\begin{itemize}
	   \item the precondition of the  overriden method \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}} must  imply
	         the precondition of the overriding method  \methodd{}
	   \item the postcondition of the overriding method  \methodd{}  must imply 
	         the postcondition of the overriden method \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}}. This  must be true for normal postcondition and
		 every  exceptional postcondition case
	\end{itemize}


Thus, we get also the following conditions for establishing the correctness of a method \methodd{} if method \methodd{}  overrides method \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}}:
$$
  \begin{array}{l}
         \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}} . \pre \Rightarrow \methodd{}.\pre\\\\
	 \methodd{}.\normalPost \Rightarrow \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}} .\normalPost\\\\
	  \forall \mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}} , \methodd{}.\excPostSpec(\mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}}  )    \Rightarrow \mbox{\rm\texttt{n}}.\excPostSpec(\mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}}  )
   \end{array}
$$

The verfication conditions for a class \class{} are the set of verification conditions for every method declared in \class.
The verification conditoins  for a program \Program{} are the verification conditions for all the classes in \Program{}.
