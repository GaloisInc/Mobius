The weakest precondition calculates  the predicate weakest precondition predicate $WP$  statement $\stmt$ in method \methodd \ from our source language,
for any normal postcondition $\normalPostSrc$ and exceptional postcondition function $\excPostSrc$, 
 such that if it holds in the pre state of $\stmt$ and   if $\stmt$ terminates normally then $\normalPostSrc$  holds in the poststate and
 if $\stmt$ terminates on exception \Exc{} then $\excPostSrc(\Exc)$ holds. 
The function $\excPostSrc$ \ returns the predicate $\excPostSrc (\mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}}) $ that must hold in a particular program point if
 at this point an exception of type \mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}} is thrown.

In the following, we will use function updates $\update{\excPostSrc}{\Exc'}{ P } $ over $\excPostSrc $ which are defined in the usual way
$$
\update{\excPostSrc}{\Exc'}{ P }( \Exc )  = 
       \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
         P & if \ \Exc  <: \Exc'  \\
         \excPostSrc(\Exc ) & else 
     \end{array}\right.$$
We can now  focus on the definition of a weakest precondition predicate transformer function over the source language.
