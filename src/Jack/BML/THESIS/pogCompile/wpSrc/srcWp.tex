\subsection{Weakest Predicate Transformer for the Source Language } \label{pog:wpSrc}

The weakest precondition calculates for every statement $\stmt$ in method \methodd \ from our source language,
for any normal postcondition $Post$ and exceptional postcondition function $\excPostSrc$ ($ \mbox{ \rm \texttt{Exc}} \rightarrow \stmt \rightarrow \formulaSrc $),
 the predicate $Pre$ such that if it holds in the pre state of $\stmt$ and   if $\stmt$ terminates normally then $Post$ holds in the poststate and
 if $\stmt$ terminates on exception $Exc$ then $\excPostSrc(Exc, \stmt)$ holds. 
In the following, in  subsection   \ref{pog:wpSrc:excPost} we discuss how the exceptional postcondition function is defined.
Subsections \ref{pog:wpSrc:wpExpr} and  \ref{pog:wpSrc:wpStmt} present respectively
 the definition of \wpName \  function for expressions and for statements.  
 



\subsubsection{Exceptional Postcondition Function}\label{pog:wpSrc:excPost}

As we stated earlier the weakest predicate transformer manages both the normal and
 exceptional termination of  an expression(statement). 
In both cases the expression(statement) has to satisfy some condition : 
the normal postcondition in case of normal termination and the exceptional postcondition
for exception $\texttt{Exc}$ if it terminates on exception $\texttt{Exc}$


We introduce a function $\excPostSrc$  which maps exception types to predicates  

$$ \excPostSrc :  \mbox{\rm \texttt{ ETypes  }}  \longrightarrow   Predicate $$ 



The function $\excPostSrc$ \ returns the predicate $\excPostSrc (\texttt{Exc}) $ that must hold in a particular program point if
 at this point an exception of type \texttt{Exc} is thrown.

%The function $\excPostSpecSrc $ returns for any exception \texttt{Exc}  thrown by the method the predicate that must hold in the 
% method exceptional termination state caused by throwing an exception of type \texttt{Exc}.




We also use  function updates for $\excPostSrc$ which are defined in the usual way


$$
\update{\excPostSrc}{\texttt{Exc'} }{ P }(\texttt{Exc}, exp)  = 
       \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
         P & if \texttt{Exc} <: \texttt{Exc'}  \\
         \excPostSrc(\texttt{Exc}, exp ) & else 
     \end{array}\right.$$
