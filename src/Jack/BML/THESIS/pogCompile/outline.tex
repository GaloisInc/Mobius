\section{Proof outline}\label{pogEquiv:outline}


For establishing the relation between the verification conditions
produced over a source Java - like language and its corresponding
bytecode we will proceed in the following way. 

First, a verification condition generator  over a Java-like language will
be defined. The verification condition generator is based on a weakest precondition function. The language has the basic Java features: object manipulation
 and creation, method invokations, exceptions etc. This is done in Section 
\ref{}

The next step is to define a compiler from the source language to 
the bytecode defined already in Chapter \ref{opSem:prelim}. The compiler 
generates bytecode which enjoys certain properties which will play 
a role in the proof. Both th
