\subsection{Properties of the compiler function}

A property that can be established for the compiler is the following: 

\newtheorem{compProp1}{Property} 

\begin{compProp1}
  For any statement $\stmt$, the compilation $\compile{\stmt}$ does not contain jump instructions ( \mbox{ \rm \instr{goto}, \instr{if\_cond} }) outside $\compile{\stmt}$ except possibly for the last
instruction in  $\compile{\stmt}$.
\end{compProp1}
The property can be established by structural induction of the compilation $\compile{\stmt}$
