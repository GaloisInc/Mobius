\subsection{Related Work}\label{pog:relWork}

Several works dealing with the relation between 
source and its compilation verification condition generated.

Barthe, Rezk and Saabas in \ref{} also argue that proof obligations produced
over source code and
bytecode produced by a nonoptimizing compiler   are equivalent.
The source language supports method invokation, exception throwing and handling.They do not consider instructions that may throw
runtime exceptions. Note that because of this 

 However, in the article they do not discuss at all what are the assumptions
or properties of the compiler which will guarantee this equivalence. We claim that their proof for the verification condition preserving compilation holds only if their non optimizing compiler has the properties discussed here in Section
 \ref{compile}. \todo{because they do not expose those conditions, 
they cannot use the induction hypothesis because they have not proven that the condition to apply the induction hold}
