\section{Motivations}

Security becomes more and more an important feature of software applications in particular in the presence of mobile code.
 An effort has been done in many directions. For example,
 techniques for verification of source programs like Hoare logic has been developed for a long time.   
 bytecode verification techniques, Proof Carrying Code and the certifying compiler.  

This document presents a relation between the verification of high level programs and their compiled version. 
The applications for this work can be a PCC for nontrivial prop
