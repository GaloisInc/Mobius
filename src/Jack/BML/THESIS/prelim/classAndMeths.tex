 \subsection{Classes, Fields and Methods}\label{clazz}
 Java programs are a set of classes. As the JVM says \textit{ A class declaration specifies a new reference type and provides its implementation. \ldots
 The body of a class declares members (fields and methods), static initializers, and constructors. }
 In our formalisation, the set of classes is denoted with $\ClassSet$, the set of fields with $\FieldSet$, the set of methods $\MethodSet$.
 We define a domain for class names \ClassName, for field names \FieldName \ and for method names \MethodName respectively.

 An object of type \ClassSet \ is a tuple with the following components: list of field objects (\fields), which are declared in this class,
 list of the methods declared in the class (\methods), the name of the class (\className)   and the super class of the class (\superClass)  :


 $$ \begin{array}{l}
          \forall  \clazz : \ClassSet , \\
         \clazz = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \fields   & :    list \FieldSet \\
                                          \methods   & :    list \MethodSet\\
					  \className & :   \ClassName \\
					  \superClass& :   \ClassSet
                    \end{array} \right\}
   \end{array} $$

 A field object is a tuple that contains the unique field id and a field type, as well as where as the class where it is declared :  
 $$ \begin{array}{l} \forall \fieldd : \FieldSet, \\
       \fieldd = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}  \fieldName & : \FieldName;\\
                                     \fieldType &  : \JavaType; \\
				     \declaredIn & : \JavaClass
                     \end{array} \right\}
   \end{array} $$
 We introduce a special field which stands for the number of components of any reference pointing to an array object and which does not belong to any class
 (the name of the object and its field  \fieldName \ have the same name ):
 $$  \length =  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}  \fieldName & = \length;\\
                               \fieldType  & = int; \\
			       \declaredIn & = \bottom
                     \end{array} \right\}$$
 
% We assume that for any two different fields $\fieldd_1$ and $\fieldd_2$ their names are different : 
% $$\fieldd_1 \neq \fieldd_2 \Rightarrow \fieldd_1.fieldName \neq  \fieldd_2.fieldName  $$

 A method has a unique method id ( \methodName), a return type (\retType),
 a list containing the formal parameter names and their types(\args), 
 the number of its formal parameters (\numArgs),
 list of bytecode instructions representing its body (\body)
 and the entry point instruction of the method (\entryPoint)
 (the instruction at which every execution of the method starts), 
 the exception handler table ( \excHandlerTable )

 $$ \begin{array}{l}  \forall \methodd: \MethodSet, \\
                     \methodd  = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}  \methodName & :\MethodName\\
						          \retType & :\JavaType\\
							  \args &  : (name * \JavaType) [] \\
							  \numArgs & : nat \\
							  \body &  : \bcIns [] \\
							  \entryPoint  &  : \bcIns\\
							  \excHandlerTable & : \ExcHandler []
                                     \end{array}  \right\}
     \end{array} $$
  
 We assume that for every method \methodd the entrypoint is the first instruction in the array of instructions 
 of which its body consists, i.e. $ \methodd.\entryPoint =\methodd.\body[0]  $.


 An object of type \ExcHandler \ contains information about the region in the method body that it protects, i.e. the start
 position (\pcStart) of the region and the end position ( \pcEnd ), about the exception it protects from (\exc),
 as well as what position in the method body the exception handler starts (\pcHandler) at.


 $$ \begin{array}{l}  \forall \excHH: \ExcHandler, \\
                     \excHH  = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \pcStart & : nat\\
						          \pcEnd & : nat\\
							  \pcHandler &  : (name * type)[] \\
							  \exc & : \ClassSet_{exc} 
                                        \end{array}  \right\}
     \end{array} $$
 
% For getting the value of any of the attributes in a class, method or field object we use the notation \textit{ name of the object . name of the attribute }
