\subsection{Registers}\label{register}
State configurations have an array of registers which is
 denoted with    
\locVarOnly. Registers are addressed by indexing and 
 the index of the first register  is 0. 
Thus, \locVarOnly(0) stands for the first register in the state configuration.
 An integer is be considered to be an index into the register array if and only if that integer is between zero and one less than the size of the register array.
Registers are used to pass parameters on method invocation. On static method
 invocation, any parameters are passed in consecutive registers starting from register \locVarOnly(0). The register \locVarOnly(0) is always used to pass a
 reference to the object on which the instance method is being invoked
 (\texttt{this} in the Java programming language). 
The other parameters are subsequently passed in consecutive registers starting at register at index 1.
