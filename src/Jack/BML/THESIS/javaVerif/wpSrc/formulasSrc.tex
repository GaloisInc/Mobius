\subsection{Source assertion language} \label{formulasSrc}
The properties that our predicate calculus treats are from first order predicate logic.
In particular, the assertion language is exactly the same as the bytecode assertion language described 
in Chapter \ref{assertLang} with few exceptions. First, 
the source assertion language does not contain stack expressions ($\stack{\counter + - \ldots}$ and \counter)
because the latter make sense only for bytecode. The second different point  is that the
identifiers  for variables, fields, classes, methods correspond to their names in the source code. Note that this is not the case for the
bytecode assertion language defined in Chapter  \ref{assertLang} where identifiers are either indexes from the constant pool table (this is the case for field , method and class names)
or indexes in the array of local variables ( in the case for method local variables and parameters).
