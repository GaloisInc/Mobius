We proceed here with the presentation of the weakest predicate transformer function. We would like first to remark
that our predicate transformer deals both with normal and exceptional termination of programs and thus, the predicate transformer
takes as arguments a statement  $\stmt$, a normal postcondition 
$\normalPostSrc$ and an exceptional postcondition function  $\excPostSrc$.
Before entering into more technical details let us see what is the intended meaning of the predicate $WP$ that 
should be calculated by a weakest predicate transformer function against  $\stmt$,
$\normalPostSrc$ and  $\excPostSrc$. The predicate    $WP$ must be 
 such that if it holds in the pre state of $\stmt$ and   if $\stmt$ terminates normally then $\normalPostSrc$  holds in the poststate and
 if $\stmt$ terminates on exception \Exc{} then $\excPostSrc(\Exc)$ holds. 
The function $\excPostSrc$ \ returns the predicate $\excPostSrc (\mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}}) $ that must hold in a particular program point if
 at this point an exception of type \mbox{\rm\texttt{Exc}} is thrown.

In the following, we will use function updates $\update{\excPostSrc}{\Exc'}{ P } $ over $\excPostSrc $ which are defined in the usual way
$$
\update{\excPostSrc}{\Exc'}{ P }( \Exc )  = 
       \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
         P & if \ \Exc  <: \Exc'  \\
         \excPostSrc(\Exc ) & else 
     \end{array}\right.$$
We can now  focus on the definition of a weakest precondition predicate transformer function over the source language.
