\section{Compiler from JML to BML} \label{intro:jml2bml}

 
One would ask why we need this bridge between source and bytecode specification. Or put it differently, why not
writing or inferring specification directly on bytecode.
 
For properties like well typedness specification can be inferred automatically,
but in the general case this problem is not decidable.  
Thus, for more sophisticated policies, an automatic inference will not work.
A compiler from JML to BML  makes the Java  bytecode benefit from
 %the source specification by defining the BML language and
 a compiler from JML  towards BML.
