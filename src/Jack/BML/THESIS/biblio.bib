Abstract     = "This paper presents experiments on formal validation of Java
applets. It describes a tool that has been developed at the Gemplus Research
Labs. This tool allows to formally prove Java classes annotated with JML, an
annotation language for Java that provides a framework for specifying class
invariants and methods behaviours. The foundations and the main features of
the tool are presented. The most innovative part of the tool is that it is
tailored to be used by Java programmers, without any particular background in
formal methods. To reduce the difficulty of using formal techniques, it aims
to provide a user-friendly interface which hides to developers most of the
formal features and provides a ``Java style view'' of lemmas."}
