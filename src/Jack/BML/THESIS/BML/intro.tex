%\section{Introduction} \label{bcsl}
This chapter presents the bytecode level specification language, called for short BML and a compiler from a
 subset of the high level Java specification language JML to BML which from now we shall call \JMLtoBML. 
The chapter is organized as follows.
 In section \ref{BCSLprelim}, we give an overview of the main features of JML. A detailed overview of BML is given in section \ref{BCSLgrammar}.  
  As we stated before, we support also a compiler from the high level specification language JML into BML. The 
 compilation process from JML to BML is discussed in section  \ref{BCSLcompile}.
 The full specification of the new user defined Java attributes in which the JML specification is compiled is given in the appendix.
