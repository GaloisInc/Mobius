\section{BML type checker}
In Section \ref{BCSLgrammar}, we gave the formal grammar of BML.
However, we are interested in a strict subset of 
the specifications that can be generated from this grammar.

In what follows, we scatch the rules of a typechecker which 
recognizes a well formed specification

\subsection{Well formed BML expressions}
We now turn to few rules which check if a BML expression is correct.
We first need to define several functions that will be used by the type checker.


Note that it is a partial function and is defined 
 


$$\begin{array}{l}
  \frac{ \begin{array}{l}
          \constantPool , \locVarTab \vdash   \expression \\
	   0 \le \ident < \constantPool.length \\
	  \constantPool(\ident ) = \mbox{\rm\textbf{CONSTANT\_Fieldref}}  \\   
	   \getType(\expression) =  \constantPool ( \constantPool (\ident).class\_index )   
	 \end{array} 
  }{ \constantPool , \locVarTab \vdash \expression.\ident  }_{wf \ field \ access}
  %\frac{   }{ } \\
\end{array}
$$
