In this chapter, we shall see how a bytecode verification condition generator can be used 
for checking a software component w.r.t. to bounded memory consumption policies.
We  propose also an annotation inference algorithm against such policies.


The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. 
Section \ref{sec:motivation} gives several motivating examples.
In section \ref{sec:principles},  we begin by describing the principles of our
approach. Section \ref{sec:examples} illustrates the approach with several examples on recursive methods, exception, inheritance.
Section \ref{sec:infer} presents an algorithm for inferring method specification for constraint memory consumption policies 
in terms of preconditions, postconditions and loop invariants. 
Finally, section \ref{sec:rel} presents an overview of related works.
