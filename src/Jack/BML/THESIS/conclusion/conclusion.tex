In the end of this thesis, we would like to summerize 
its contents and to focus on the future objectives. 

% done. summary
So far, we have seen how to perform verification over bytecode
programs without compromising the compiler. In particular, the verification 
scheme proposed allows to check a bytecode program against 
non trivial functional and security properties. For this, we have 
introduced a specification language BML tailored to Java bytecode, a compiler
from the Java source specification language JML to BML and a verification 
condition generator for Java bytecode programs. Moreover, we have
shown that the verification procedure over Java like source program 
and Java like bytecode are syntactically equivalent (modulo names and types). 

% to do.PCC
A next step is to build a PCC framework from the  components 
mentioned above. To do this,  it is still missing the proof
certificate, the decision procedure used by the code producer 
for building the certificate  as well as the type checker used by the code
client for checking the certificate. Interesting problem 
in this direction is efficiency 
will be how to produce certificates with an
optimal size and to define ``small'' type checkers.

% to do. type systems
Another interesting perspective for continuation is the encoding 
of type systems into a bytecode logic. 
Type systems provide a high level of automation. 
Their encoding in the verification condition generator can be useful
especially on where the certificate checking is performed on a 
 device which is potentially with limited resources.
