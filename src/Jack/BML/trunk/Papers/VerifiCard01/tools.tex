\subsection{\sc Esc/Java}
\textsc{Esc/Java} is the verification tool developed at
Compaq SRC (Compaq Systems Research Center), which allow us to find
some errors in \textsc{Java} programs. \textsc{Esc/Java} allow us to
detect, at compile time, errors which usually are not detected until
run time. \\

\textsc{Esc/Java} includes an annotation langage with which
programmers can express design decisions using light weight
specifications. For example, one may give a method preconditions that
says than parameter is not null, or declare an object invariant that
says than an integer field lies between $0$ and the length of some
array field. \textsc{Esc/Java} uses the given annotations in reducing
spurious warnings, and also checks that the program is consistent with 
the given annotations. \\

\textsc{Esc/Java} performs a \textit{modular checking}, i.e,
\textsc{Esc/Java} checks each class separately. That means that
\textsc{Esc/Java} can be applied to code that calls libraries even if
the code for the libraries is not available. \\
