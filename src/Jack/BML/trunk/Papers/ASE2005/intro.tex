\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
The present paper addresses the  problem of establishing trust in software components that originate from untrusted or unknown producers. 
The question concerns important areas like 
smart card applications, mobile phones, bank cards, ID cards and whatever scenario where untrusted code should be installed and executed.

 In particular, depending on what is the level of trust the code receiver wants to establish, 
the state of the art proposes different solutions. 
For example, the verification may be performed over the source code. 
In this case, the code receiver should make the compromise to trust the compiler, which is problematic. 
The bytecode verification technique proposes another solution, which does not require to trust the compiler. 
The bytecode verifier performs the static analysis directly over the bytecode yet, it can only guarantee that 
the code is well typed and well structured. %that the bytecode does not violate the proper function of the virtual machine. 
The Proof Carrying Code paradigm (PCC) and the certifying compiler \cite{Necula97,ComNec,DesNecLee98} are another alternative.
 In this architecture, the untrusted code
is accompanied by a proof for its safety w.r.t. to some safety property and the code receiver has just to generate the 
verification conditions and type check the proof against them. 
The proof is generated automatically by the certifying compiler for properties like well typedness or safe memory access. 
As the certifying compiler is designed to be completely automatic, it will not be able to deal with rich functional or security properties. 
 
We propose a verification framework with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item translating source program annotation into bytecode annotation.
 Thus bytecode can benefit from the source specification and does not need to be accompanied by its source code. Moreover, 
this approach is suitable for scenarios where the consumer requirements are potentially complex and a full automatic specification inference
will fail. 
   \item establishing the correctness of Java bytecode programs using a verification condition generator over Java bytecode, which supports
the bytecode annotation.
\end{itemize}
%The scheme is suitable for consumer-producer scenarios where the consumer requirements are potentially complex. Using this framework, the producer can generate and supply, along the bytecode, the specification information sufficient for the 
%client to establish that the code respects those requirements. 
The scheme can potentially be used in a PCC framework. In particular, we aim at compiling source proofs into bytecode proofs. 

% trust between a client and a code producer against 
% non trivial security or functional  policies, where the untrusted code is likely to lack its source code. 
%More generally, the framework can be applied to scenarios where the code producer has to implement or fulfill some client requirements.
%Using this framework, the producer can generate and supply, along the bytecode, the specification information sufficient for the 
%client to establish that the code respects those requirements.    

In particular, our approach is tailored to Java bytecode.
The Java technology finds a large application in mobile and embedded components because of its portability across platforms. 
For instance, its dialect JavaCard is largely used in smart card applications and the J2ME Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) finds application in GSM mobile components. 
In this article we propose a static verification technique using formal methods for sequential Java bytecode programs.

The aforementioned scheme is composed by several components.
We define a bytecode logic in terms of weakest precondition calculus for the sequential Java bytecode language. 
The logic gives rules for almost all Java bytecode instructions and supports the Java specific features like 
exceptions, references, method calls and subroutines.  
 We define a bytecode specification language, called BCSL, and supply a compiler from 
 the high level Java specification language JML~\cite{JMLRefMan} to BCSL. 
 BCSL supports a JML subset which is expressive enough to specify rich functional properties. The specification is 
 inserted in the class file format in newly defined attributes, thus making not only the code mobile but also its specification. These class
 file extensions do not affect the JVM performance. The scheme makes the Java bytecode benefit from the specification written at source level.
 We have implementations of a verification condition generator based on the weakest precondition calculus and of the JML specification compiler. Both are integrated in the Java Applet Correctness Kit (JACK)~\cite{BRL-JACK}.
