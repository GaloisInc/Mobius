\section{Implementation and Results}
 As we already mentioned you have implementations of the JML compiler and a verification condition generator which is integrated in the tool JACK \footnote{ http://www-sop.inria.fr/everest/soft/Jack/jack.html}.
 The tool is a plugin for the eclipse \todo{referenced - the eclipse site} integrated development environment for Java which uses formal methods for
statically checking Java programs against their JML specification. The tool can interface with several theorem provers (AtelierB, 
Simplify, Coq, PVS ) \todo{references}. Jack has a user-friendly interface which makes it easy for use by developers that do not have
a large background in formal methods.

Here we want to discuss some practical issues. First, the JML compilation augments the file size twice. For the example given at fig.~\ref{replaceSrc}, the class 
file withot the specification extensions is 548 bytes, and its extension with BCSL is 954 bytes. At source level there were generated 13 proof obligations, which 
were proved interactively in Coq.
