%\section{Implementation and Results}\label{results}


Here we discuss some experimental results. 
The JML compilation augments around twice the file size. 
For the example given at fig.~\ref{replaceSrc}, the class file without the specification extensions is 548 bytes, 
and the class with the BCSL extension BCSL is 954 bytes. The JML compilation for this class took 3000 ms. On bytecode level, Jack generated 4 proof obligations,  
which were also proven interactively with Coq. On source level of the program 13 proof obligations, 
which were proved interactively in Coq. The proof obligations on source and bytecode level are basically the same modulo 
 local variable names and field names; the difference in their number is due to differences in the implementation of $wp$ on source and bytecode level.
