\section{Implementation and Results}\label{results}

Here we want to discuss some practical issues. First, the JML compilation augments around twice the file size. For the example given at fig.~\ref{replaceSrc}, the class file without the specification extensions is 548 bytes, and its extension with BCSL is 954 bytes. At source level there were generated 13 proof obligations, which were proved interactively in Coq. At bytecode level there were generated 4 proof obligations, which were proven interactively with Coq. The proof obligations on source and bytecode level are basically the same modulo some names. The difference in their number is due to the fact that a single bytecode proof obligation corresponds to several on source level (because of implementation differences).
