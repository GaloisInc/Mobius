\section{Verifying Java Bytecode Programs}\label{vcg}
Bytecode programs represent a set of Java classes. Establishing the correctness of Java bytecode program consists of generating verification conditions for every method appearing in any class of the bytecode program.
The verification procedure has the following steps :
\begin{itemize}
\item for every method \texttt{m} calculate the weakest precondition $\wpi(\tt{m})$ its specification:  precondition $\psi^{pre}(m)$ , postcondition $\psi^{post}(m)$
\item  for every method \texttt{m} prove the condition 
$$
\psi^{pre}(m)  \Rightarrow \wpi(m)
$$    
\end{itemize}
