We propose a framework for establishing trust in untrusted Java bytecode components w.r.t. to complex functional and/or security policies. In particular, the bytecode component may potentially not be provided with its source code. To do this we define a logic for sequential Java bytecode in terms of a weakest precondition calculus and a bytecode specification language (BCSL). BCSL and the logic are expressive enough for verifying non trivial program properties. The logic supports the Java bytecode specific features - exceptions, subroutines, references and object creation and gives semantics to the BCSL specification. As traditionally program specification is written on source level, we propose a compiler from the high level Java Modeling Language (JML) in BCSL. This allows bytecode programs to benefit from the source specification. A verification condition generator based on the defined bytecode logic and the specification compiler are implemented and integrated in the Java Applet Correctness Kit (JACK).
