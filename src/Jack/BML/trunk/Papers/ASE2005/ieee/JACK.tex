\section{Proving bytecode correctness with JACK}\label{jack}

Once the proof obligations are generated, the next step is trying to establish their validity. To do this we use the Java Applet Correctness Kit (JACK). 
In this context, we use the capability of the tool to translate a formula given in, what we can call the Jack Proof Obligations Language (JPOL) into provers languages.
The tool allows to load class file proof obligations, to display them in different language like JPOL, PVS, B, Coq, ..., to call different provers (automatic or interactive) on the proof obligations and then to collapse together the results to give a result on the validation.
