We propose a logic for sequential Java bytecode based on a weakest precondition calculus and a bytecode specification language (BCSL). BCSL and the logic defined allow expressing and checking complex functional and interface properties. The logic supports the Java specific features - exceptions, subroutines, references and object creation and gives semantics to the BCSL specification. We propose a compiler from the high level Java Modeling Language (JML) in BCSL. The compiled JML annotation is added to the class file format in the form of user defined attributes. This allows bytecode programs to benefit the specification on source level. Both the compiler and the weakest precondition calculus have been implemented and integrated in the Java Applet Correctness Kit (JACK).
