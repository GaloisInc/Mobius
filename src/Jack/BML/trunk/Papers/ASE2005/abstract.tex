We propose a framework for establishing the correctness of untrusted
Java bytecode components w.r.t. to complex functional and/or security
policies. To this end, we define a bytecode specification language
(BCSL) and a weakest precondition calculus for sequential Java
bytecode. BCSL and the calculus are expressive enough for verifying
non-trivial properties of programs, and cover most of sequential Java
bytecode, including exceptions, subroutines, references, object
creation and method calls.

Our approach does not require that bytecode components are provided
with their source code. Nevertheless, we provide a means to
compile JML annotations into BCSL annotations 
by defining a compiler from the Java Modeling Language (JML) to BCSL.
Our compiler can be used in combination with most Java compilers to
produce extended class files from JML-annotated Java source programs.

All components, including the verification condition generator and the
compiler are implemented and integrated in the Java Applet Correctness
Kit (JACK).
