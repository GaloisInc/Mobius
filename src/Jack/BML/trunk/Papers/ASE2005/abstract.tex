We propose a logic for sequential java bytecode based on a weakest precondition calculus and a bytecode specification language (BCSL). 
The logic supports the Java specific features - exceptions, subroutines, references and object creation and gives semantics to the BCSL specification. The BCSL and the logic defined  allow expressing and checking complex functional and interface properties. We propose a compiler from the high level Java specification language JML in BCSL. The compiled JML annotation is added to the class file format in the form of user defined attributes. This makes automatic the process of bytecode annotation.  Both the compiler and the weakest precondition calculus are implemented and integrated in the Java Applet Correctness Kit (JACK) \footnote{http://www-sop.inria.fr/everest/soft/Jack/jack.html}.
