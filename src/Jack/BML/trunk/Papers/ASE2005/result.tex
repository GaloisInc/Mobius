\section{Implementation and Results}
 As we already mentioned you have implementations of the JML compiler and a verification condition generator which is integrated in the tool JACK.
 The tool is a plugin for the eclipse \todo{referenced - the eclipse site} integrated development environment for Java which uses formal methods for
statically checking Java programs againts their JML specification. The tool can interface with several theorem provers (AtelierB, 
Simplify, Coq, PVS ) \todo{references}. Jack has a user-friendly interface which makes it easy for use by developers that do not have
a large background in formal methods.
