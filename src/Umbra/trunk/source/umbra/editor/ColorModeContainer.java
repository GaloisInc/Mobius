/**
 * This class is a static container that keeps the value of current colouring
 * style that is obtained after each refreshing (which takes place when
 * a byte code document is created too).
 *
 * This class has two modes of operation:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The "class unknown" mode - in this case a special greyish colouring
 *        style is returned by the methods. This colouring indicates that the
 *        byte code has no connection with a class file so the editing will not
 *        change any class file.</li>
 *   <li>The "class known" mode - in this case a real colouring style is
 *        returned by the methods. This colouring indicates that the byte code
 *        has connection with a class file so the editing will change the
 *        corresponding class file. This mode is set on in moments when we
 *        know how to associate the class file to its textual representation.
 *        </li>
 * </ul>
 * Most of the time the class of a byte code textual representation that is
 * fed to Umbra is not known so the default mode here is "class unknown" and
 * the intent is to change this mode only for short periods when the class
 * is indeed known.
