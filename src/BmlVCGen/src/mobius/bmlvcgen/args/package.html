</head>
<body>
<p>
This package contains classes used to parse command-line arguments.
Parsing is performed by instances of class 
{@link mobius.bmlvcgen.args.ArgParser ArgParser}. Each parser contains a set 
of {@link mobius.bmlvcgen.args.Option Option} objects, describing possible 
option names. Options can be marked as required. They can have long 
and short names and (possibly optional) arguments.
</p>
<p>
Command-line syntax recognized by this package is similar to that
accepted by getopt.
</p>
<p>
Classes in package {@link mobius.bmlvcgen.args.annot} can be used to 
construct parsers from annotated objects.
