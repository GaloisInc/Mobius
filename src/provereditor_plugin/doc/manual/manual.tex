provers.

\subsection{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item You need a recent Eclipse (preferred 3.1+)
\item A working Coq installation (with a proper ide, coqc and coqtop).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Installation}
In eclipse go to Help > Find And Install; select the option 
'Search for new feature to install'; click on Next; then click on 
'New Remote Site'... and then that's done.\\
After that you are asked if you want to restart Eclipse. It is better
to answer yes to this question.
