Overview of the Program Verification Environment
</H1>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Many large software engineering projects have functional
specifications that are thousands of pages long.  These are usually
written in a natural language, such as English, and with semi-formal
notation such as diagrams and tables.  There are often subtle
ambiguities or internal contradictions within the software
requirements, which are often not discovered until very late in the
software development life cycle, simply because the project becomes
too big for any one developer or analyst to fully understand and
remember all the relevant details at the same time.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Popular high-level ``modeling'' languages in current use ( e.g., UML) are
not amenable to formal analysis because of a lack of semantics and
interoperable tool support.  Even so, high-level representations are
compelling and useful in modern software engineering practice and
software engineers regularly struggle with using these inadequate
languages, even for mission critical applications.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> is a customized version of the Eclipse platform that
integrates a set of tools that support software development using
state-of-the-art formal methods and software engineering techniques.
The <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> supports the specification and verification of <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">JML</SPAN>-annotated
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Java</SPAN> programs at the source code level as well as at the bytecode
level using logic- and type-based techniques and the Proof-Carrying
Code paradigm.  The properties of particular interest include security
(e.g., data is secret and never leaked) and resource guarantee
properties (e.g., this method will never use more than this much memory
or that much CPU) as well as total functional correctness.  The <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> 
is thus, in a sense, a prototype realization of the U.K.&nbsp;Grand
Challenge 6 Verifying Compiler, specialized to the domain of Java
programs&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node86.html#HoareM05">HM05</A>].
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">The <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> integrates theoretical and technical best-practices,
leveraging the hard work of many research groups within, as well as
outside of, the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">MOBIUS</SPAN> grant consortium.  Many <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Java</SPAN> software
engineers use the Eclipse development environment, together with
plugins such as <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">FindBugs</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">PMD</SPAN>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node86.html#Eclipse">Ecl</A>].  The <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> is
bundled with Eclipse and these well-known third-party plugins so that
Java developers are presented with a pre-configured development
environment without the need to manually install each plugin.
</BIG>
<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE">For example, a <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Java</SPAN> developer might use the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> to derive a <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">JML</SPAN> 
specification from a high-level functional specification.  The <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">JML</SPAN> 
subsystem of <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">MOBIUS</SPAN> might then be used to typecheck the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">JML</SPAN> 
specification, and, in a complementary fashion, the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">ESC/Java2</SPAN> used
look for inconsistencies in the specification.  A variety of other
pre-configured subsystems like <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">CheckStyle</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">FindBugs</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">PMD</SPAN>, and
others are executed asynchronously while the developer writes,
modifies, and evolves their software architecture.  Feedback about the
completeness and quality of the system's documentation, formal
specification, and program code are always at the developer's
fingertips.  Once the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Java</SPAN> code has been verified against the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">JML</SPAN> 
specification, both statically using <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">ESC/Java2</SPAN> and dynamically using
hand-written and automatically generated unit tests using <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">JML</SPAN>'s
runtime assertion checking, then the developer has very high
confidence that the requirements have been implemented correctly.  At
this stage, one performs automatic and interactive verification using
the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">MOBIUS</SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">DirectVCGen</SPAN> and Prover Editor, fully verifying functional and
non-functional properties.

<BIG CLASS="LARGE">Recent editions of the <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Mobius PVE</SPAN> has been used at several tutorials run at
international conferences including ETAPS, the GLOBAN Summer School
run by <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">MOBIUS</SPAN> partner UW, in courses taught at UCD, and at the JML
Spec-a-thon held at the University of Washington, Tacoma in May 2009.
